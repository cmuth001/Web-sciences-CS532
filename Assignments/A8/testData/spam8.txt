Dear colleague,

My name is Charles Anderson and I am writing to ask whether you and / or the students of your department require editorial assistance.

I am part of a collective called Editing Press, which is a group of published junior academics from Oxford and Cambridge universities who are also professional editors. We edit technical and non-technical material to an exceptionally high standard and specialize in journal articles and dissertations (including formatting assistance for house styles, such as APA and Chicago). We combine the academic's eye for detail with the editor's commitment to meticulous delivery, all in keeping with standing rules of academic conduct. If you think that this service may be of use to you and / or your department's students, it would be a pleasure to hear from you. If you wish to peruse our website, the link is www.editing.press.

We also have a pro bono editing and writing service for asylum seekers and refugees, the details of which are also on our website. If you know of anyone who might benefit from this, please do pass along our details.

With best wishes,

      Charles Anderson
