Hello Ariel,

My happiness knew no bounds to share such a great news. 

We team of five attended with team name "Arrow" attended  Hackathon U6 by Dominion Enterprise, Norfolk, VA.  Am so glad to say that we backed with third prize among the nine teams that participated representing different universities around Virginia. This is a two day Hackathon, happened on 22nd and 23rd February at Dominion enterprise. 

We received a shield and 2500$ cash prize. The Vice President and the administration staff at Dominion Enterprise were glad with the workflow and the presentation by our ODU students. 

I think this will be a nice thing to add to the website and also in the Department's spring Newsletter to showcase the talent of our Computer Science students. 

Attached are the few pictures captured after the awards ceremony.
