The 2018 Winona State University football recruiting class is large in quantity and mass.
The Warriors added 43 players to the fold on National Signing Day on Wednesday, with 17 coming along the offensive and defensive lines.
Highlighting the Warriors’ seven-player defensive line class is Winona Daily News Football Player of the Year Nick Waldo of Winona Senior High School. Waldo had 10 sacks, 20 tackles for loss, three forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and two interceptions. He led the Winhawks to the Minnesota Class AAAA state semifinal in 2017, following a loss in the state title game in 2016.
The 6-foot-3, 250-pounder played multiple positions along both lines for the Winhawks and was the Big Southeast-Blue lineman of the year. On the Warriors defensive line, he will be reunited with former teammate Jacob Stanislawski, who joined WSU in 2017 and redshirted last fall.
The 10-player offensive line class features two Division I transfers in Vincent Magana, formerly of the University of Minnesota, and Scotty Topole, formerly of Northern Illinois.
The 6-3, 285-pound Magana from was a two-time All-Minnesota Collegiate Athletic Conference player for Central Lakes College as a freshman and sophomore before transferring to Minnesota in 2017. As a sophomore, he led the way for an offense that averaged 191.9 rushing yards per game and won a conference championship with an 11-0 record.
Topolo (6-5, 275) was a member of the Huskies’ 2015 recruiting class and was a scout team player of the year for NIU. He was an All-Fox Valley Conference player as a high school senior at Cary-Grove High School in Cary, Ill.
Also joining the massive offensive line class are Justin Precour (6-5, 300) of Lake in the Hills, Ill.; Braxton Seeman (6-4, 300) of Barron, Wis. — the hometown of WSU coach Tom Sawyer — Dominic Shelley (6-6, 316) of Somerset, Wis.; Carson Madigan (6-3, 260) of Hudson, Wis.; Jordan Haddad (6-3, 275) of Mequon, Wis.; Tristan Preiss (6-4, 270) of Rochester; Payton Dachel (6-3, 265) of Bloomer, Wis.; and Nick Wedig (6-4, 250) of Dousman, Wis.
The Warriors’ 43-player recruiting class of 2018 features 10 players from Minnesota, 17 from Wisconsin, 12 from Illinois, three from Iowa, and one from Missouri. On top of the 10 offensive linemen and seven defensive linemen, there are eight defensive backs, six linebackers, four wide receivers, three tight ends, one fullback, two running backs, one quarterback, and one kicker.
Keagan Maloney of St. Charles joins the receiver group after totalling five touchdowns and 86 tackles for the Saints in 2017. He was a two-time all-conference player at running back, wide receiver and outside linebacker.
A.J. Frisby was a three-year starter at quarterback for Wilmot Union High School. He gained 4,867 total yards and scored 63 touchdowns in his career and was a one-time player of the week in the state of Wisconsin. He missed part of his senior season with a torn ACL suffered on Oct. 5.
The run-first Warriors add a pair of highly productive running backs to its already deep stable of ball-carriers — Justin Evans of Menomonie, Wis. and Drew Becker of Holmen, Wis.
Evans, 5-11, 205, rushed for 1,946 yards and 31 touchdowns in 2017. He was the 2017 Big Rivers Conference Player of the Year, first-team all-conference, all-region, all-state honorable mention, and was the Eau Claire Leader Telegram All-Northwest Wis. Player of the Year.
Becker, 5-10, 175, rushed for 1,501 yards and 19 touchdowns in 2017. He was elected first-team all conference, all-region and was a state honorable mention.
One of the most productive running backs in Minnesota joins the Winona State as a linebacker. Grand Meadow’s Zach Myhre rushed for 2,162 yards and 28 touchdowns, while averaging 9.3 yards per carry as a senior. But the two-way preps player will show off his defensive prowess as a collegian. He was the 2017 Southeast Conference Defensive Player of the Year and had 359 career tackles.
