The Real West Ham Fans Action Group (RWHFAG) has been set up to galvanise the club to make good on promises made when moving from Upton Park to the London stadium  generally and primarily in two key areas:
bringing the crowd closer to the pitch and a comprehensive display of the clubs heritage both on the external stadium facade and facing the playing surface
Ultimately RWHFAG want a ground fit for football and an experience fit for fans
whilst the administration of running the group is on a self funded volunteer basis, effecting change of the magnitude required will be enabled mote effectively with monetary contributions which have been offered but to date declined due to lack of transparency - this just giving page affords an opportunity for said transparency.
