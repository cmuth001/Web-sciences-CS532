The World Cup is just around the corner (get excited!), and ahead of the footballing summer showpiece, nations are revealing their strips for the competition in Russia.
Including Spain and Belgium.
The pair of European giants have unveiled their strips, inspired by previous editions.
And Nigeria have taken a leaf out of Spain and Belgium's book by creating a clothing range based on their 1994 World Cup campaign.
The results: outstanding.
Time to gawk - check out Nigeria's home World Cup shirt as modeled by Arsenal's Alex Iwobi:
