Eagles 9-3 Patriots - 2nd quarter 13:00
Punt is caught by Amendola at the Pats' 37. First punt of the game that. It's been a thriller so far.
Ertz, who's very good, should've caught that pass. Pats caught a break.
12:15AM
Eagles 9-3 Patriots - 2nd quarter 13:00
Short run and then Foles throws it away to bring up 3rd & 8. Foles under pressure, escapes, and then the pass to Ertz is incomplete, no flag. Eagles will punt.
12:13AM
Eagles 9-3 Patriots - 2nd quarter 14:00
Pats go for a run on 3rd & 2Â but can't get there. Field goal, Gostkowski... snap is bobbled, down, but Gostkowski hits the upright! Three points off the board. Crazy. Eagles start at their own 20.

Eagles 9-3 Patriots -Â end of 1st quarter
Run back by Lewis doesn't get much. Brady's turn to respond. Eagles ownerÂ here alongside, yes, Bradley Cooper.

8-yard runs gets them going before Gronkowski is penalised for a false start. Incomplete, 3rd & 7...
Brady deep to Amendola for a huge gain down the sidelines! Blown coverage by the Eagles and the Pats are at the Eagles' 30. Wow.
Brady next on play-action, gain of 12 to Hogan. Eagles really struggling with the tempo as White runs for six. White on the run again, just short of the first down and that's the end of the first quarter.
Here's that outstanding Jeffery touchdown.

TOUCHDOWN JEFFERY! Eagles 9-3 Patriots
Barner runs back the kick-off to the 24-yard line. Agholor working hard after the catch, picking up seven. Blount with a huge run! Powers his way into Pats territory down the outside, 36 yards. The ex-Pat will have loved that.
Foles airs it out... Touchdown Jeffery! Eagles with the first score! Foles with play-action, 34 yards, and Jeffery gets above Rowe to bring it in. Extra points is...Â missed!?Â Didn't see that coming.

FIELD GOAL GOSTKOWSKI! Eagles 3-3 Patriots
26-yard strike and we're all square. Very similar opening drives. Those underneath throws for Brady are working like a treat.

Eagles 3-0 Patriots - 1st quarter 4:00
White prominent early on, catching another pass for six. Run on second down, White stopped for one. So here comes 3rd & 4...
Down the middle for Gronk but Mills gets in there to break it up. 4th down and the Pats will tie this up with a field goal.
11:50PM
Eagles 3-0 Patriots - 1st quarter 6:00
Brady's first pass hits the ground short of Mitchell. Stands in the pocket and hits White, last season's Super Bowl hero, for a first down and 15 yards.
Screen on the next play to White called back... Eagles had 12 men on the field so that's a five-yard penalty.
Play-action, loads of time and space for Brady to hit Hogan for a big gain of 28. Those short passes so effective and the Eagles are losing steam.
End-around to Hogan, knocked out at the Eagles' 23. 2nd & 6. Play-action again to hit Gronk for another first down. Pats in the red zone. Brady 3/4 for 52 yards already.
11:47PM
Eagles 3-0 Patriots - 1st quarter 8:00
Elliott's kick-off finds the end zone so Dion Lewis takes a knee. Pats and Brady will start from their 25-yard line.

FIELD GOAL ELLIOTT! Eagles 3-0 Patriots
Chip shot by Elliott gives the Eagles the lead from 25 yards.
That's what the Eagles have done all January. Execute clock-chewing scoring marches. That opening field-goal drive ate up seven-plus minutes off 14 plays. Some nice work by Foles along the way.
11:41PM
Eagles 0-0 Patriots - 1st quarter 8:00
Short run and then an offside penalty on Ertz backs the Eagles up a little. Foles throws out the back of the end zone to Agholor, nothing there. 3rd & Goal.
Play-action, Foles to Jeffery... incomplete. Long drive but out comes the field-goal unit for the Eagles. Good pressure by the veteran Harrison there for the Patriots, Rowe there in coverage on Jeffery.
11:39PM
Eagles 0-0 Patriots - 1st quarter 9:00
Nice drive building. Ertz with his first catch for seven yards, up to the Pats' 30. Ajayi on the run picks up a first down.
Draw play opens up a lane down the middle for Ajayi to pick up six. Look at that huge hole.

Clement in - these Eagles running backs are so good - and makes a huge gain inside the 5-yard line on a screen! Eagles can strike here, 10 plays into this drive.
11:36PM
Eagles 0-0 Patriots - 1st quarter 12:00
Blount, who won the Super Bowl last year with the Pats, gets stuffed on a run by Van Noy. Loss of two. That's a worry for Philly.
Foles slings one towards Torrey Smith but he can't haul it in, 3rd & 12. Down the middle by Foles... Smith comes up with it! Great throw and catch, Eagles drive stays alive. Inside Patriots territory.
11:34PM
Eagles 0-0 Patriots - 1st quarter 13:00
Agholor on a slant picks up four, nice start for Foles. Back to the same receiver for two more to set up 3rd & 4.Â 
Lots of time for Foles who finds Jeffery, first down near midfield for the Eagles.
11:31PM
Super Bowl LII is underway!Â 
Gostkowski drills the opening kick-off, fielded by Clement for the Eagles and goes out of bounds at the 25-yard line.
Pats win the toss, defer the kick-off
Nick Foles, you're up my friend.

Quick prediction
I can't look past Brady. This season, even at 40, his body of work has been special, and that includes a mild slump in the second half. He's the GOAT (although personally I'd rather have Aaron Rodgers...)
The Eagles, however, have a fantastic front seven led by Fletcher Cox and great talent at running back. If Foles can replicates his heroics from a fortnight ago, who knows.Â Â 
Belichick and Brady to do it again.Â Patriots 27Â Eagles 21
Patriots too! Not long now
