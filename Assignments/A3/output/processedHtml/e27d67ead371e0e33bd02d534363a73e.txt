National Signing Day is supposed to be one of the best days of a high school football player's career. Jacob Copeland, a four-star wide receiver from Escambia, Florida, had a signing day that was more bizarre than special.
The 6-foot, 190-pounder committed to the Gators over Alabama and Tennessee live on ESPN2, and his mother clearly wasn't happy. 
Right after picking up the Florida hat, his mother -- wearing an Alabama shirt and Tennessee hat -- got out of her chair, grabbed her purse and walked out of the shot moments after her son's big commitment.

"We had a lot of conversations back and forth about where I should go to school," Copeland said while being interviewed on television during the awkward situation. "God led me and my gut led me to where my heart desired. I can't go with my mind, I got to go with my heart."
Copeland is a talented player who is stepping into a great situation at Florida under first-year coach Dan Mullen. While his signing day itself was awkward, he has a tremendous future ahead of him. 
His mother also came back after the interview was over and signed the Letter of Intent and gave her son a hug.
