The Tulane Green Wave are proving that 2018 is the year they take another step. How could be possible, that a Four Star recruit lands in New Orleans at a little private school that has struggled for years? This all seems a bit hard to believe for some. However, with Coach Willie Fritz leading this program, this is going to be an expectation soon enough.
Tulane Signs Four Star DE Alfred Thomas
Alfred Thomas hails out of Sidney Lanier High School in Montgomery, Alabama. He stands at 6-foot-2 and weighing almost 270 pounds. Here are just some of the other universities that gave him offers : Georgia, Georgia Tech, Memphis, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Tulane isn’t exactly a known juggeraut in football just yet. But they will.
Back in December, even before today’s signing, Tulane ranked at #66 in the nation according to 247Sports. Furthermore, this ranking is the biggest achievement since 14 years ago back in 2004. The Wave just narrowly missed out on a bowl game last year after a heart-breaking loss to SMU in the last seconds in 2017.
Still, the 5-7 record is nothing to sneeze at. In 2013, the Green Wave did have a winning record at 7-6, but before that, one would have to go back to 2002. Also, the immediate impact that Willie Fritz and his staff are making are felt locally. In 2018, there have beenÂ  eight players inked to play for Tulane and last year just two were signed from Louisiana.
Signing Thomas was a huge deal. Thomas attended the Under Armour All-America Camp and had Georgia in his crosshairs just a year ago. Thomas is willing to do whatever it takes to fit in and make an impact immediately. He’s got speed and an uncanny ability to make plays all over the field. Watch some of his explosive bursts and Superman vision as he stays with the play.
Tulane won’t have to wait to the end of the season this year to make a bowl game. The wave is coming is 2018.
