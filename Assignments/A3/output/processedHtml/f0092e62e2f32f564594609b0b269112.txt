Josh McDaniels might not have believed Luck on his side

Did uncertainty regarding Andrew Luck ’s shoulder have anything to do with Josh McDaniels leaving the Indianapolis Colts at the altar?
Certainly, McDaniels would have asked about the star quarterback before Tuesday, when he backed out of a reported deal to become the Indianapolis head coach. No one knows the truth except the principals involved.
All we can say from the outside is that the shoulder could have been a factor.
We have long pointed out the questions brought up by the delays in Luck’s progress and have asserted multiple times the best course for Luck – for certainty about his recovery – might have been to undergo arthroscopic surgery.
McDaniels’ first head coaching job was somewhat derailed by not having a true franchise quarterback in Denver.
Right now, the hope is the Colts have theirs healthy. But there is no way to tell for sure.
Things may look positive. But the Colt expressed optimism before the 2017 season and Luck never played.
I am not saying Luck won't be healthy this year, but I am saying there is no way to know for sure right now.
He has just started throwing and will likely need at least three months of throwing rehab and progression for anyone to feel certain, as we explained here .
We brought up recently that the Colts might not be 100 percent certain about Luck’s health even when the draft rolls around. This uncertainty may have played a role in McDaniels’ change of heart.
Remember, throwing a football is in many ways harder than pitching, as much of quarterback’s tosses come on the move, shuffling feet and changing arm angles reacting to the defense. Standard start for throwing rehab is more static. Thus it is a matter of progression, and that could easily take three months or more to become fully dynamic.
McDaniels certainly knew some of this uncertainty when he interviewed and ostensibly agreed to take the job. However, perhaps with a reported meeting with Patriots owner Robert Kraft , who sweetened McDaniels’ current financial deal to remain New England’s offensive coordinator, in combination with any remaining fear of the unknown with Luck led to the change of heart.
It was just Sunday that ESPN’s Chris Mortensen reported there are doctors who believe Luck may need further surgery.
Only the runaway bride knows the real story of why the Colts are again looking for a coach.
