The nation’s #5 player picked Alabama because “they win championships.”
The leviathan that is the SBN mothership underestimated the power of the Bama crootin fan base and has overheated. We are on our fourth server and needed to open a new thread to finish out the day.
An odd recruiting season turned a bit odder as a few Tide players unexpectedly flipped to other teams on NSD. There has been talk on the old Interwebz that some of it was orchestrated by a certain former Bama defensive coordinator to the east, so that he can puff out his chest.
The day is not over yet but it appears the Crimson Tide might come up short of the projected 23 signees. But fear not; There is a silver lining or two. Alabama concentrated on signing defense, collecting 12 for that side of the ball as opposed to five on the offensive side. The Tide is absolutely STACKED on offense already. Another point to make is that overall across the nation, this has not been the strongest of classes of seniors. 2019 and 2020 are looking much more robust. And finally, know that this day will drive Nick Saban all that much more to destroy his foes in the future. Don’t be surprised if Saban comes close to completely filling his class in this coming December’s Early Signing Period.
Regardless of what Twitter might say, this is still a strong recruiting class for Alabama.

HOW TO WATCH:
ESPNU 3pm-6pm
SEC Network has PAAWWWLLLL Finebaum.
Nick Saban will hold his Signing Day press conference at 4pm which can also be seen live on Rolltide.com .
That second one is very telling. Clearly, one or more recruits had pledged to Alabama and did not inform the staff they were flipping. Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
STILL TO COME
Saban: “We’re actually hoping to get one more defensive lineman in this class.”
Saban on no QB: “We’ll probably have a quarterback join us in some kind of way.” I assume this is Preferred walk-on Braxton Barker. But could they have their eyes on a grad-transfer or a juco player?
