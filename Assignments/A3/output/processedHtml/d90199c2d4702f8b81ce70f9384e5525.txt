Tight end Ryland Goede is one of the headliners of Georgia's 2019 recruiting class.
Nation’s No. 6 junior TE Ryland Goede commits to UGA
February 7, 2018
It’s tough to top the No. 1 signing class in the nation if you’re Georgia.
Georgia picked up its seventh signee with the elite 5-star rating on National Signing Day in Tyson Campbell . The Bulldogs also flipped two in-state commits, Otis Reese and Quay Walker, who were bound for Power 5 schools on Wednesday.
But for an encore?
Georgia tightened its grip on the nation’s top class for 2019, too. Junior Ryland Goede , a 4-star tight end from Kennesaw Mountain High, also committed to UGA on Wednesday in a live announcement at Sports and Social in Smyrna, Ga.
Goede rates as the nation’s No. 6 tight end on the 247Sports composite. He also checks in at No. 161 overall in the junior class.
The 6-foot-7, 235-pound player plays three sports at his high school. He shoot in the mid-70s in golf, belts 400-foot homers as a legitimate pro baseball prospect and also holds 19 offers from all the major powers in college football.
He chose Georgia over Auburn and Michigan on Wednesday. It dates back to relationships. His lifelong best friends, JD Bertrand and Dominick Blaylock, already have committed to UGA for 2019. Those three always are either hanging out or working out together.
Goede has known Kirby Smart since his early years as a prospect. He used National Signing Day for 2018 to go ahead and end the suspense regarding his decision.
“All I bleed now is red and black,” Goede told DawgNation.
