The Ibrox board have been granted an overdraft of “modest millions” with Close Brothers to fund a range of projects at the club.  Record Sport  understands the facility is less than £3 million, but managing director Stewart Robertson insists there is no danger of chairman Dave King and his fellow investors withdrawing their backing.  He has also refuted suggestions the club, who have relied on soft loans from King and Co in recent years, are cash-strapped.         Rangers Managing Director Stewart Robertson  (Image: SNS Group)   Rather, Robertson says it’s evidence of the credibility of the current board among City moneymen as Rangers prepare to launch a share issue later in the year.  Robertson said: “It’s another positive step in the club moving forward. We turn over more than £30 million a year and there are very few businesses with that level of turnover that don’t have a banking facility.  “Some folk take pleasure in winding us up because we don’t have a bank facility but this is the next stage in moving the club forward and getting it onto a sensible business footing.  “As trite as it sounds, the money is almost incidental. it’s about someone having belief in the club and the way it is being run as we move forward and normalise operations.         Rangers chairman Dave King  (Image: PA Wire)    Read More   Graeme Murty and Pedro Caixinha’s Rangers records compared    “Dave and the other investors remain firmly behind the club. The contingency is still there if we need money for a particular project or to head into the transfer market in the summer.  “We need to get to the position we’re a self sustaining football club. That has always been the target. We can’t keep going back to the well.  “A £30 million business with no bank facilities is very, very unusual. It’s another step and it’s about doing it within the realms of financial prudence.  “We’re not going daft with it, we’re doing it within the framework of what the business can afford and it involves modest millions, which are sustainable and serviceable.  “We must operate at a sensible level and the banks aren’t going to throw silly sums of money at clubs going forward. There is a check and balance on the whole thing.”    Read More   Rangers fans split over Josh Windass celebration that told the critics to 'shut it'    The overdraft will be secured against Edmiston House and the Albion car park and is in addition to the £7 million King promised auditors he’d underwrite for any losses in the current financial year.  The facility will be used to bolster the club’s finances at a time of the year when clubs are traditionally stretched and it also comes ahead of the start next week of a £3 million refurb of the Ibrox fabric.  Robertson added: “It’s general working capital, because finances are stronger in the summer when season ticket and SPFL money comes in.  “There's lots of work going on around the stadium, which lifts the morale of people who work here, as well as the supporters who can see what’s going on.  “We’ve put out all the fires and now we can put the foundations down to take Ibrox back to where it should be as a stadium.  “Close Brothers would not have come to us if they thought there were still issues with the club in any shape or form so it’s a vote of confidence in the way Rangers are moving forward.  “They can see the investment already made and there’s a share issue coming down the road as well. Step by step we’re beginning to make progress.”         Lord Bannatyne ruled David King must offer investors 20p per share for the share capital not already controlled by him and three other businessmen    Read More   Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos 'no longer transfer target' for Beijing Rehne    King is currently in talks with the Takeover Panel after they ordered him to make an offer of 20 pence a share after he was found to have acted in concert with the Three Bears when seizing control of the club three years ago.  King appealed the decision by the Court of Session and that issue needs to be resolved before Rangers can offer a new shares issue.  Rangers knocked back a bid from Chinese club Beijing Renhe for Alfredo Morelos last week that could have netted them up to £7.5 million.  Robertson said: “There’s still a way to go but we’re getting into a position where we’re much stronger than we were. We’re trying to build a squad rather than take it apart.”    poll loading   Are Rangers improving under Graeme Murty?  15000+ VOTES SO FAR   Yes  No   Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter DailyRecordSport Follow @Record_Sport Subscribe to our Daily newsletter Enter email Subscribe More On Rangers FC Dave King Ibrox Stadium Scottish Premiership Sport all Most Read Most Recent Rangers FC James Tavernier's ambition at Rangers is great but I fear he's too good to achieve it - Barry Ferguson Barry reckons the defender is destined to go far but hopes he can achieve his dreams at Ibrox.
