The Strongest finished 2nd in the league last year scoring the most goals. Recently they have been out of form and without a win in 3 games.  They will be looking to get back to winning ways tonight and kick start back off their season. Although they are without a win in 3, one of these losses was the last game of the season when they fielded a weak side.
I am Expecting them to put a strong 11 out tonight and come out guns blazing right from kick off. We should see the likes of Escobar, Ibarguen and Wayar.
Nacional Potosi are not a bad side on Home soil unbeaten in 6 games Winning 5 of them. But they have only managed 2 clean sheets in the 7 games played.
Expecting another attacking game. But low stakes as season has only just got back underway.
