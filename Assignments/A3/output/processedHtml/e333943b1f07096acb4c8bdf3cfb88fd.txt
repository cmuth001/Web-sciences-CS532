As Chelsea continue to struggle, Antonio Conte's future remains uncertain but where could he go next?
Speaking after his summer arrival, the 25-year-old said: “I came to Chelsea because one club and one coach believed in me. 
“Now I have all of these things and I’m very happy.”
Diario Gol say Morata fears his importance at Chelsea will lessen if Conte is axed.
And he is also supposedly unhappy at the club’s plans to replace him with Luis Enrique.
Meanwhile, pundit Ian Wright expects Conte to go - but only at the end of the current campaign.

Chelsea news: Antonio Conte signed Alvaro Morata back in the summer
"No I do not (think he will still be at Chelsea next season)," the former Arsenal striker said on The Debate.
"When you see him talking about and actually mentioning the length of his contract, saying, 'I have 18 months left and I am not going' it is almost as if he is saying, 'if they want me to go, they are going to have to get rid of me'.
"It is a sad situation that they now find themselves in because I cannot understand that Chelsea would promise him something else for him to be getting so angry like he is.
"I genuinely believe it is because Chelsea have stuck to their guns and said, 'no, we are going to buy the players'.
"So no, I do not think he will still be there next season as the people upstairs have now had enough."
