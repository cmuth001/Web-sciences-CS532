All these players are currently out of contract, including ex-Arsenal duo and former Man United wonderkid
Antalyaspor signed Nasri from Manchester City last summer, but he only lasted five months in Turkey. On January 31 his contract was terminated having made just eight appearances for the Super Lig club. He is now available on a free transfer, and is still only 30-years-old. A former France international, Nasri started his career at Marseille before joining Arsenal, then Manchester City. He won two Premier League titles with City, but was sent out on loan last season before being sold prior to the start of 2017/18.

Just a few weeks after David Sullivan insisted West Ham will NOT be signing older players, Patrice Evra has joined the Hammers.
“We will have to bring in two or three in January,” Sullivan, the West Ham co-owner, said. “They will be young players, they won’t be 32.”
Well, it’s good to see he is sticking to his morals; Evra is not 32… he is 36!
The former Manchester United star has penned a deal with West Ham, arriving at the London Stadium on a free transfer, having been sacked by Marseille towards the end of 2017.
He was one of a number of famous players out-of-contract before arriving at West Ham, but who remains a free agent?
