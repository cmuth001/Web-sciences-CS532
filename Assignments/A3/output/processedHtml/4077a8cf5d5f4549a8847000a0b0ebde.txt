Atlantic City finished 6-4 last fall, ending the season with a 36-32 win over rival Holy Spirit. Vikings wide receiver Nah’Sir Morgan signed in December to attend Division I University of Maine.
“It means the world to me and the coaches,” Atlantic City coach Thomas Kelly said of his players going to college. “This is what we signed up for. Wins and losses are important, but these guys going to college is what it’s all about.”
Derry excelled at quarterback, running back, wide receiver and defensive back for the Vikings. He couldn’t have had a better tour guide when he visited Virginia Union last month. Pete Hunter, a 1996 Atlantic City graduate and Virginia Union All-American, flew in from Texas to show him around. Hunter played five years as defensive back in the NFL, mostly with the Dallas Cowboys.
“Pete was a big part of my decision,” Derry said. “Me and him are really close. I talk to him all the time.”
Derry caught 32 passes for 489 yards last fall. He also threw for 738 yards and ran for 301 yards. Derry scored 11 touchdowns.
Virginia Union finished 6-4 last season. Derry said the Virginia Union coaches see him as an offensive player, most likely wide receiver.
“They made me feel at home,” Derry said of the Virginia Union coaches. “The campus is not big, so you know everyone there.”
Jones starred at linebacker for the Vikings. He will play a combination of linebacker and defensive back for Shepherd. The Rams finished 10-1 last season. Running back Ifreke Andy, a 2017 Absegami graduate, was a redshirt freshman at Shepherd last fall.
“What I really liked about Shepherd was the football tradition,” Jones said. “The football tradition got me on board.”
Jones said he plans to major in business.
“This is really exciting,” Jones said. “Growing up ever since I was young I always wanted to play college football. Now, getting this scholarship to Shepherd is taking me one step closer to my dream.”
