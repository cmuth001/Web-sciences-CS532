A feature on the top wide receivers that appeared in the 2017 CBS Sports/Beckett Sports “Fantasy Football 2017 Draft Guide” earned noted Fantasy Football author Jamey Eisenberg an award for excellence Tuesday night.
Eisenberg beat out four other nominees to win the Fantasy Sports Writers Association’s 2017 “”Best Football Article – Print” for his “Best of the Best” feature detailing the elite eight wide receivers heading into the 2017 season. The piece was published in both the Spring and Summer issues of the 2017 CBS Sports/Beckett Sports Fantasy Football magazine.
“I was just proud to work with Beckett to produce a quality preview article on wide receivers,” Eisenberg said, “and I look forward to doing more of the same with our upcoming Fantasy Football articles in 2018 and the future.”
The FSWA’s award winners were announced Feb. 6 on SiriusXM Fantasy Sports Radio. This is the 14th year the FSWA has awarded excellence in Fantasy Sports writing and broadcasting.
