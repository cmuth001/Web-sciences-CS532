Feb 07, 2018
BUFFALO, NY - University at Buffalo football head coach Lance Leipold announced the addition of two more signees to the 2018 recruiting class on Wednesday. Joey Banks, a safety transfer from City College of San Francisco and Gabe Wallace, an offensive lineman from British Columbia, were added to the 14 players the Bulls signed back in December.
Banks enrolled at UB in January and will be eligible to practice with the team during the upcoming spring practice period. He had 67 tackles, seven tackles for loss and a sack in 2017. A native of Sacramento, CA, Banks was an All-State performer at Franklin High School where he had 155 tackles and 10.5 sacks his senior season.
Wallace, a 6-6, 315 lb. offensive lineman, hails from Salmon Arm, British Columbia where he played at St. Andrew's College. Wallace is the top-ranked offensive lineman in Canada according to Canada Football Chat.
Combined with the initial class signed in December, the 16-member class is comprised of four offensive linemen, three defensive linemen, two linebackers, two running backs, a wide receiver, a tight end, a quarterback, a safety and a defensive back. The newest class comes to UB from seven different states and Canada, including New York (5), New Jersey (2), Ohio (2), Maryland (2), Mississippi, Hawaii, California and Canada (2).
"We are extremely excited about this class," Leipold said. "This is absolutely the best we've done in Western New York and the state. As we continue to evolve as a staff and as a program, we understand what it's takes to compete in the Mid-American Conference. It's exciting as we continue to recruit players that are not just athletic, but have high character and strong academics."
