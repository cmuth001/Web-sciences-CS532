Nike Flyknit has evolved rather quickly since its debut in 2012. First emerging as a flat upper formed into the shape of a foot and lasted onto a sole, this knit material has been re-engineered over the last half-decade to be more elastic, form-fitting, and durable for athletes Today, Nike unveils its newest form of this revolutionary material called Flyknit 360, which allows the shoe upper to be constructed in complete 360-degree form. Simply put, this means that Flyknit will fit better, which results in heightened security and control. The earliest adopters of Flyknit know that because the fit of Flyknit uppers weren’t quite perfect, this led to funky creasing at the toe and heel slippage. These issues have since been addressed, but Flyknit 360 is taking it a step further, so to speak.
Flyknit 360 just debuted on Nike’s newest chapter of the storied Mercurial line – the Mercurial Superfly 360 and the Mercurial Vapor 360. Nike promises that Flyknit 360 will appear on other footwear across other sports, which means the potential for lifestyle-ready iterations exists as well.
