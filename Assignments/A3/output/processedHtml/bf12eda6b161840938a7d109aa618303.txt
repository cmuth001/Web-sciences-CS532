St. Augustine's National Signing Day ceremony didn't hold the drama that others did, but it was a special moment for the players and their families.
A total of 13 Purple Knights participated in the annual Wednesday rite of passage for high school seniors, signing with seven colleges.
Tulane signee Juan Monjarres, a 6-2, 215-pound defensive end, signed his letter-of-intent in December but still enjoyed the moment.
"I signed in December, but I wanted to do the signing day part with my brothers," he said. "I knew I wanted to go to Tulane since like ninth grade before I got offered by them. I just want to help Tulane get their sacks up. I feel like I'm going to bring my dominant pass rush to Tulane and help win some games."
Western Kentucky signee Garland LaFrance said he was proud to start the next chapter in his football life with his brothers, who have been playing together since ninth grade.
"This is just the next chapter," he said. "Football ain't over for me. I've got four more years and maybe more after that. This day means a lot to me. Western Kentucky has been recruiting me real hard. I only went on one official before them, but on that visit (to Western Kentucky), it felt like home."
The 5-foot-10, 180-pound tailback originally committed to Tulane in June but flipped to Texas Tech. He later reopened his recruitment and picked the Hilltoppers after his visit.
Defensive tackle Dante' Carter (5-11, 315) and defensive back Donniel Ward Magee (5-10, 160) both signed with Southeastern.
"I just wanted to be close to home to make sure my family could come out to my games," Carter said. "It's a good system that I can fit in."
St. Augustine coach Al Jones, who retired in December after three seasons, said watching his players sign was special.
"I think this is the culmination of something good," he said. "Today is what it is all about. The bottom line is these young men are prepared to go to the next level. What I think is special is that several of them are going to the same school. They'll have somebody that they can lean on because we have players going to Minnesota, Missouri and Kentucky."
