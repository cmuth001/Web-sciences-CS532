Wednesday's recruiting misses must have felt like a splash of cold water on Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh's back.(

Just when you thought Michigan's day couldn't get any worse Wednesday, "Little Brother" opted for Ohio State over an offer from the Wolverines.
Five-star offensive tackle prospect Nicholas Petit-Frere - whose French last name translates to "little brother" -  chose to sign with arch-rival Ohio State on national signing day.
The Tampa, Fla., resident is not so little at 6-foot-6 and 272 pounds.
He's actually a big deal, ranked as the No. 7 overall prospect nationally for the 2018 class and coveted by most of the big programs like every other five-star prospect.
What hurts for the Wolverines is that Michigan was the first school to offer Petit-Frere a scholarship. But things didn't fall right for Michigan during the recruiting process, and he ultimately chose another route.
It was only part of a rough signing day for the Wolverines, who saw their highest-ranked unsigned recruit flip to Georgia. Otis Reese is a four-star linebacker who had been committed to Michigan since June 2016.
On top of that, Davison star running back Tariq Reid had an offer to join the Michigan program as a preferred walk-on, but he  chose to stick with his commitment to Division II Grand Valley State and signed with the Lakers.
Geez ... and you thought Michigan State was treated like the "little brother."
