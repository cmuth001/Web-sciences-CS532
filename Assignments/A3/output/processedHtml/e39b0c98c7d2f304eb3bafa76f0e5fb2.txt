Georgia narrowly lost the national championship on the field last season, but it ran away with the top spot in the recruiting rankings by landing seven five-star recruits, according to 247Sports' rankings . No other team in the country got more than five five-star recruits.
In the first full recruiting season under Tom Herman, Texas had its best recruiting haul in several years, landing two five-star recruits and nearly cornering the market in Houston by signing nine of the city's top 15 recruits.

Jimbo Fisher got off to a late recruiting start since being hired by Texas A&M in December, but he closed incredibly strong. Going into Wednesday's National Signing Day, the Aggies had the 35th-ranked recruiting class, but by the end of the day had jumped all the way up to No. 17.
