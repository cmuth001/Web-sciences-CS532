"We want to continue this run"
Tottenham 2-0 Newport County
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino speaking to BBC: "It's the FA Cup and it's difficult. But I am happy because we wanted to be in the next round.
"It's important they [Danny Rose, Toby Alderweireld, Erik Lamela etc.] are all fit so we can be competitive. We need all the players available.
"Son Heung-min is doing fantastic this season and he feels important.
"It is important to keep going and winning games. We are going to be very busy in the Premier League, Champions League and the FA Cup but we want to keep this run.
"I haven't seen the pitch at Rochdale but I heard about it. First, we need to think about Saturday, but it will be tough to win again in the FA Cup. It's step by step now."
