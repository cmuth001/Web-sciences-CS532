What are the key talking points for the incoming group? Here are some things to know: Santa is coming, early signing effect and local Redhawks
Once again it's the first Wednesday in February, which means it's National Signing Day.
This year is a little different from the past, in that an early signing window in late December gave college recruits an opportunity to sign before today, thinning out the action a bit on what has become a sort of national holiday for diehard college sports fans.
Southeast Missouri State football announced Wednesday a signing class of 22 total players, 13 of which were inked back in December during the early window. That left nine to join the fold today.
Look for more on the signing class later.
The positional breakdown is as follows:
QB: 3
