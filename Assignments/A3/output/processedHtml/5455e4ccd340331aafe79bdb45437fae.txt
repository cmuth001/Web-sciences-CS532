UPDATE (3:58 p.m., Feb. 7): Baker Mayfield has deleted his tweet.Â 
Noted Twitter user and 2017 Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield couldn’t resist responding to a Texas football signee’s promise to Longhorn fans.
Houston Westfield defensive tackle Keondre Coburn signed with the ‘Horns on Wednesday and promised Texas would beat Oklahoma (along with the “rest of them”) in his commitment tweet.
Iâm so happy to finally be a longhorn baby this has been the hardest process ever but itâs over and my next journey is in Austin and with my boys in this Revolution Class AND I PROMISE WE WILL BEAT OU and the rest of themđ¤đžđ pic.twitter.com/5Il1vSAmpB

Mayfield, the now-former Oklahoma quarterback, fired back at the high school senior with a lesson on the Red River Showdown.
 
As most know, this isn’t the first time Mayfield got into it with someone on Twitter. And it probably won’t be the last.
Mayfield, an avid defender of Oklahoma football on social media, led the Sooners to wins over the Longhorns in 2016 and 2017. He won’t be around next year for the big game in Dallas, but it appears graduation won’t stop from Mayfield for putting on for the team he guided to two College Football Playoff appearances and three Big 12 titles.
