Position/Ranking: 4-star cornerback/No. 2 (JUCO)
Junior College: Mississippi Gulf Coast CC (Perkinston, Miss.)
Alabama doesn't frequently go the junior college route for recruiting, but it made an exception with Saivion Smith . He was the No. 48 player in the 2016 class and played in 10 games as a true freshman for LSU that year before transferring. With a JUCO season under his belt, he'll be ready to step in and challenge for a starting spot in the secondary.

Position/Ranking: 5-star cornerback/No. 6 overall
High School: American Heritage (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)
Patrick Surtain Jr. was the highest-rated uncommitted player in the 2018 class entering national signing day. He was also widely expected to choose LSU, which had been his leader for some time, yet Alabama managed to sway him. The top-ranked cornerback in the country is the son of former NFL corner Patrick Surtain Sr., a second-round pick of the Miami Dolphins in 1998 who played 11 NFL seasons and had 37 career interceptions.

Position/Ranking: 4-star wide receiver/No. 39 overall
High School: Episcopal (Bellaire, Texas)
Jaylen Waddle , who was one of the last top 100 players in the country to choose his school, went with Alabama over Oregon, TCU, Texas and Texas A&M. The fifth-best receiver in his class is on the small side but more than makes up for it with speed and explosiveness. He is a potential yards-after-catch wizard as well as someone who can break off big plays in the return game.
