NIGERIA
National Team Collection
As the Nigerian National Team steps into this summer's tournament, the world will know they've arrived. The federation's infectious charisma shines through in the flamboyant Nigeria collection. 
Featuring a travel suit, anthem jacket, training apparel, pre-game shirt, bucket hat and kits, the Nigeria collection will stand out in the stadium and on the street.
Fast Fit Vaporknit Technology
On-Pitch Innovation
Designed with performance in mind, the home and away kits feature breathable new Vaporknit technology for reduced weight and cling, while cooling zones mapped to the body's hot spots help keep athletes comfortable on the pitch. Outer seams have been removed from the shorts, reducing friction and increasing range of motion.
National Pride Shines Through
For many, "Naija" represents a new Nigeria. The affectionate nickname embodies the national pride the federation will be bringing to Russia, and is prominently featured on the pre-match shirt, anthem jacket, drill top and bucket hat. The badge is a tribute to the crest worn by the gold medal-winning "Dream Team" of the 1996 season.
Super Eagle-Inspired Design
With a culture as vibrant as Nigeria’s, the collection had a lot to live up to. The central design theme is an abstract feather pattern inspired by the team’s “Super Eagles” nickname. Last seen during Nigeria's 1994 appearance on the world stage, the design has been enlivened to capture the energy of the 2018 team.
Travelling in Style
Perhaps the most distinct piece of the collection, the travel suit features a bright green floral design on a black base—a fresh, contemporary aesthetic to the team's colours.
