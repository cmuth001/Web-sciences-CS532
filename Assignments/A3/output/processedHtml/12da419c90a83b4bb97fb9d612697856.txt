The Christian County pipeline to Purdue continues to send talent to West Lafayette, Indiana as Colonel defensive back Cory Trice signed to play with the Boilermakers Wednesday.
Despite missing four games with a foot injury, Trice was named First Team All-State and was the Class 5A District One Player of the Year. He scored six touchdowns – three on defense and three on special teams – in 2017 and finished with 14 career interceptions.
Trice committed to Purdue over the summer and said he never waivered on his commitment to the Boilermakers.
He says his injured foot is healed and looks forward to getting into better shape for college.
Trice joins former Colonels Kenneth Major and KeyRon Catlett, who signed with Purdue last year.
