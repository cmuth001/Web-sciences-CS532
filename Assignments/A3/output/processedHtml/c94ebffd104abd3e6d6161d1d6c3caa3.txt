Colts might not know Andrew Luck's status before draft
Colts quarterback Andrew Luck has been placed on IR, now it might be best to use surgery to find out why.
Colts quarterback Andrew Luck has been placed on IR, now it might be best to use surgery to find out why.
The good news is Andrew Luck is reportedly in Los Angeles and set to begin a throwing program .
The bad news is it could take months before Andrew Luck and the Colts know his status for sure.
Last year, he threw as part of rehab but never progressed to full practice.
Typically, one throws in rehab for at least a month, then progresses to limited practice for a month and then a full-go trial.
Realistically, it may be three months or more before Luck can be sure he will be fine for the 2018 season.
I expect and hope he will do well, but there is no certainty after all he has been through the past two-plus years .
Obviously, any setback that involved surgery would at this point jeopardize his ability to play at the start of the 2018 season, which is why I lobbied for a scope to make sure .
The key here is things may look good and Luck may be progressing, but it is entirely possible that on draft day the Colts won't have a guarantee on the health of their franchise quarterback.
