San Diego State head coach Rocky Long was wracking his brain a couple of weeks ago about where the Aztecs would dress for spring practice.
SDSU is in the midst of remodeling its football locker room, a project expected to take two to three months, so the Aztecs will be without locker room facilities when spring practice begins Feb. 19.
“Maybe it’s going to be like when they played Pop Warner,” Long said at the time. “They’re going to have to dress at home, come in their gear and practice and walk home with their gear on.”
Long has come up with a better solution, although it won’t be within walking distance.
SDSU is renting the facility for a month from the City of San Diego, Long said, to use the former Chargers Park complex in Murphy Canyon. It’s been vacant since July when the Chargers relocated their offices and training facilities to Costa Mesa.
“The city was nice enough to lease it to us,” Long said. “It’s a change of scenery. It might be a whole lot of fun.”
The facility, now called Murphy Canyon Park, is located about three miles north of SDCCU Stadium off I-15, a 10-minute drive from SDSU.
The Aztecs have 15 spring practices, which will be conducted over the last two weeks of February and the first three weeks of March.
Long said accessibility for SDSU fans to watch is not up to them since it is a city-run facility. Related to that, they also do not yet know where the Aztecs’ end-of-spring scrimmage will be held. It is possible they will do it at a local high school or community college, he said.
As far as SDSU’s locker room, it will be redone with new lockers, showers, bathrooms and flooring.
“Everything’s going to be taken out of there,” Long said. “It’s going to be expanded a few feet to give us more room. Everything in the locker room is going to be brand new.”
The remodel is to replace things worn out through the years moreso than trying to keep up with the Joneses in college football.
“We won’t ever keep up with them, because we can’t make it big enough to keep up with them,” Long said. “But it will be a lot nicer.
“They will have fans in each locker so stuff dries out. They will have plug-ins in each locker so they can plug in their iPads and their phones. All that kind of stuff.”
The project is expected to cost around $2 million.
