Everton winger Theo Walcott has revealed that the chance to play under Sam Allardyce was a major factor in his decision to join the club.
The former Arsenal star said that the Blues coach is helping him play to his potential, and he backed his boss to reverse the Merseyside outfit's fortunes.
"Sam was one of the main reasons why I came to the club," Sky Sports News quotes Walcott as saying. "I wanted a manager like that, who could get the best out of me. He is eager to turn results around.
"I had that short stint with Sam with England, and to see it now every day, the way the intensity of training is and how demanding it is, has been great.
"I like to go into training every day and try to be better than the day before. I want to improve the team and anything I can do to help, I will do so."
Everton faced Walcott's former club Arsenal last weekend in the Premier League and suffered a 5-1 drubbing at the hands of the Gunners.
