“Erik Lamela doubled Tottenham's lead against Newport in their FA Cup fourth-round replay tonight”
After Harry Kane secured a replay by equalising in the 82nd minute of their previous tie, Spurs took the lead after 26 minutes in their Fourth-Round decider with Newport at Wembley tonight.
But it was an own goal from Newport’s Dan Butler that fired them in front, as Moussa Sissoko’s cross took a wicked deflection off the defender before finding the back of the net.
Erik Lamela then doubled their advantage, notching his first goal since September 2016 by slipping the ball through the legs of Newport keeper Joe Day following a lovely pass from Son Heung-Min.
So who will Mauricio Pochettino be most impressed with?
