What a wonderful book about a wonderful person. For me he is the greatest as not only is he the most gifted midfielder I have ever seen but a true, humble and professional gentleman. The book just backs up all I have ever believed about him. A real great, honest and nice person who has kept his feet on the ground despite all that he has won and the accolades he continues to get. You get a true and honest account of the hardship and torment he went through when he had to leave his parents at the age of 12. Even the pictures show how much has gone into the book with not only the important professional moments like the World cup goal, the Stamford bridge goal, his team mates and the lovely gesture to his friend Dani Jarque but more importantly of all his family and friends. There is no trashing of anyone like some footballer stories but just an honest portrayal of a good man. Anyone who loves the true art of football should read this book and this man acts not only as a model for anyone with talent looking to go into football but also a perfect example of how to conduct your life whether you have talent or not.
