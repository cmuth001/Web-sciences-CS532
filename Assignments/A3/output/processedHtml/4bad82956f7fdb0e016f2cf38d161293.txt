Arizona State and the University of Arizona both hired new football coaches within weeks of each other in the same off season.
So, who has the best deal, ASU’s Herm Edwards or Arizona’s Kevin Sumlin?
Sumlin starts with an edge. He has a higher guaranteed salary under his proposed contract going to the Arizona Board of Regents for approval Thursday— $14.5 million over five years — compared to Edwards’ $11 million.
But both of their contracts are loaded with incentives that kick in if their teams have winning seasons and do well in post-season play. 
Edwards, most recently an NFL analyst at ESPN and a former NFL head coach, has more lucrative incentives than Sumlin. His incentives could earn him a maximum of $3.7 million a year compared to Sumlin's up to $2 million a year.
There's a big caveat to keep in mind: To earn these maximum amounts, ASU or Arizona would have to win the college football national championship and meet every other goal set for them. 
Ultimately, what they end up taking home will depend on how well their teams do on the football field and in the classroom. 
Here's how their contracts stack up:  
This much is guaranteed
Sumlin has a $2 million base salary per year in the first two years, increasing to $3.5 million in years three through five. This is a faster — and higher — rate than Edwards. Total guaranteed pay: $14.5 million over five years.
Edwards earns $2 million salary a year, increasing annually by $250,000 a year every Jan. 1. Total guaranteed pay: $11 million.

Academic incentives
Arizona's state universities have put more emphasis on improving athletes' performance in the classroom. Officials want players to get a good education and graduate. The contracts of head coaches are structured to focus on these academic goals. 
Academic Progress Rate
The APR rate measures how well a sport is doing at advancing athletes toward graduation over four years. Schools must get a score of at least 930 (out of 1,000) to avoid NCAA penalties.
Edwards: Bonus of 5 percent of salary, which would be the equivalent of $100,000 in the first contract year, if APR is 965 and an additional 5 percent of salary if the APR is more than 970. The APR for ASU’s football team is 969, according to the most recent information available.
Sumlin gets a $25,000 bonus if the team meets an APR of 971 and $50,000 for 1,000 or above. The team's APR for the 2015-16 school year was 955. 
Grade Point Average and Graduation Success Rate
Grade Point Average measures how well players are doing in the classroom. The Graduation Success Rate tracks college degree completion.
Edwards gets a one-time annual payment if the team meets or exceeds: $75,000 for 2.70 GPA or 75 percent Graduation Success Rate; $125,000 for GPA of 2.80 or Graduation Success Rate of 80 percent; $200,000 for 2.90 GPA or 85 percent Graduation Success Rate; $300,000 for GPA of 3.00 or 90 percent Graduation Success Rate.
ASU's football team GPA is 2.66, and the Graduation Success Rate is 76 percent.
Sumlin gets a one-time annual payment if the team meets the following GPA: $50,000 for 2.60 GPA; $125,000 for 2.75 GPA; $175,000 to 2.90 GPA or $200,000 for 3.00 GPA. The GPA for the University of Arizona's football team for the last school year was 2.46.
Honors College Enrollment Performance Bonuses
Edwards: Eligible for bonus payments for the number of players who are enrolled in ASU’s Barrett Honors College. One student athlete is worth $50,000; two to four student athletes are worth $100,000 and five or more student athletes are worth $250,000.
Sumlin: No contract incentives related to honor college enrollment.

Limits on payouts if they are fired
Both Edwards and Sumlin have what are called "mitigation clauses" in their contracts that limit how much of a buyout they get if they are fired without cause and then take another high-profile coaching job. 
The lack of such clauses in the contracts of ASU's former head football coach Todd Graham and Arizona's Rich Rodriguez led to criticism that the universities were wasting money . 
Both coaches were fired without cause within weeks of each other, resulting in a $12 million buyout to Graham and a $6.28 million buyout to Rodriguez. 
Edwards' contract,  approved in December, gives him only 50 percent of his remaining salary if he were fired without cause and then takes a head-coaching position at any university or another university athletic position at a Power 5 school.
He'll get all of his remaining salary, however, if he doesn't take another high-profile job. 
Sumlin would get a buyout of the remaining terms of his contract — if fired without cause — equal to $10 million in the first or second year, $7.5 million in the third year, $5 million in the fourth year and $3.5 million in the fifth year. 
If he took the buyout and went onto coach at another university or professional major league sports team (or took a TV job), his buyout would be offset by any money he receives from his new employer.
