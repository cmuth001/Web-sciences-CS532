Five-star class of 2018 cornerback Olaijah Griffin will play his college football at USC, he announced on Wednesday, National Signing Day. Griffin is the No. 3 cornerback and No. 28 overall player in the class, according to the industry-consensus 247Sports Composite. He picked the Trojans over Alabama, Tennessee, and Oregon, among many others.
As his rating suggests, Griffin is a star. At a listed 6’0, he has the size to cover outside or slot receivers. He’s a top-end athlete with the speed to get downfield quickly and the short-area quickness to pounce on shorter routes. He has good ball skills and will mix in plenty of interceptions with his other pass breakups.
Griffin committed in the summer to UCLA and stayed with the Bruins until December, but he decommitted after the Early Signing Period passed without his signature. The Bruins had changed head coaches, firing Jim Mora and hiring Chip Kelly.
Griffin is the son of rapper Warren G, who brought us “Regulate.”
Warren G is also known as Warren Griffin III.
I guess you could say that while his dad has made his career out of regulating in the music industry, Olaijah has made his by regulating the middle of the field.
I’m sorry.
Anyway, Griffin has NFL upside as a lockdown cornerback.
He continues USC’s strong recent tradition of cornerback recruiting. He joins four-stars Talanoa Hufanga and Chase Williams in the Trojans’ 2018 class. They bring on at least one or two blue-chip corners every year, but Griffin is the first five-star since Jack Jones in 2016. The program has sent a handful of corners to the NFL recently, most notably the 18th overall pick in the 2017 draft, Adoree’ Jackson.
