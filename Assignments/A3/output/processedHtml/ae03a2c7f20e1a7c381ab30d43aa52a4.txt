Fans to have their say on a proposed franchise for Atlantic Canada
HALIFAX, N.S. – CFL Commissioner Randy Ambrosie will make a stop in Nova Scotia later this month to connect with fans in a town hall discussion.
Ambrosie will be in Halifax on Feb. 23 at the Westin Nova Scotia for the event, which runs from noon to 2 p.m.
His visit is an important one for Halifax, which is looking to land a CFL franchise that could begin play in 2020 or 2021.
“We’re thrilled to have the CFL include Atlantic Canada in its tour,” said Anthony LeBlanc, of Maritime Football Ltd., the group working to bring a franchise to the region. “We’re looking forward to developing the next chapter of the CFL in the Maritimes, and this road show is designed to give the league an opportunity to interact with some of the most enthusiastic football fans in the country.”
Fans will have the opportunity to ask the commissioner questions and to have their say on the proposed CFL franchise.
The event is open to the public, and organizers are hoping to fill the room with fans who are passionate about fielding a CFL team in Halifax.
In addition to LeBlanc, the Maritime Football Ltd., ownership group includes Bruce Bowser, a Halifax native who is president of AMJ Campbell Van Lines, and Gary Drummond, a businessman from Regina.
The construction of a new stadium is key to having a franchise in Halifax, and the ownership group is working on an approximate 25,000-seat facility that could be built and maintained under some kind of a public-private partnership. Constructing such a facility is expected to cost more than $200 million.
The Halifax stop is one in a series of visits Ambrosie is making in every CFL market.
