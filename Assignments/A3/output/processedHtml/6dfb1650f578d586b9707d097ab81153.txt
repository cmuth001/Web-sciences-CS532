Michigan State football signed 20 players during the NCAA's early signing period, but still could add a few more players to its 2018 class on national signing day on Wednesday.
Here are the recruits who make up MSU's class: 
School: Las Vegas (Nev.) Bishop Gorman
Vitals: 5-11, 170
247Composite rating: 3 stars (No. 119 WR/No. 751overall).
The buzz: Michigan State’s only unsigned commitment entering Wednesday chose the Spartans on Feb. 3 over Arizona State, Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, Utah and Wisconsin, among others. He is a teammate of MSU signee Jacob Isaia.
Dublin Coffman's Jeslord Boateng is a three-star prospect. The 6-2, 210-pounder plays linebacker and defensive line.

Vitals: 6-2, 220
247Composite rating: 3 stars (No. 49 OLB/No. 769 overall).
The buzz: MSU went big on Ohio in this class, and the athletic Boateng will give the Spartans track speed coming off the edge in pass rush situations and in the open field.

RB Elijah Collins
School: University of Detroit Jesuit
Vitals: 6-1, 195
247Composite rating: 3 stars (No. 49 RB/No. 865 overall).
The buzz: The versatile hard-nosed Collins also could play defense in college, but he has big-play ability at running back and the Spartans could have holes to fill with the graduation of Gerald Holmes and potential departure of LJ Scott.

Vitals: 6-5, 185
247Composite rating: 4 stars (No. 15 Pro-style QB/No. 361 overall).
The buzz: Day has the size, raw arm strength and elusive mobility MSU likes in its pro-style quarterbacks, and the state’s top QB prospect this year is expected to enroll early.
Dimitri Douglas, Saline
Vitals: 6-5, 285
247Composite rating: 3 stars (No. 49 OT/No. 635 overall).
The buzz: Another big in-state offensive lineman who could play a number of spots once he arrives on campus, Douglas is expected to enroll early.
DB Michael Dowell
School: St. Edward (Lakewood, Ohio)
Vitals: 6-0, 190
247Composite rating: 3 stars (No. 33 S/No. 441 overall).
The buzz: The third member of the Dowell family to become a Spartan, Michael profiles more like David than Andrew as a physical, downhill safety who can also defend the pass.
Kalon Gervin is a four-star prospect, according to the 247Sports Composite. He picked MSU over Oregon, after decommitting from Notre Dame. He is 5-11, 180 pounds.

DB Kalon Gervin
Vitals: 5-11, 180
247Composite rating: 4 stars (No. 19 CB/No. 177 overall).
The buzz: Gervin is expected to enroll in January and could be the gem of the Spartans’ deep incoming secondary group, a strong cover corner who has elite speed and is the second-best player in the state, per 247Sports.com.
TE Trenton Gillison
Vitals: 6-5, 220
247Composite rating: 4 stars (No. 11 TE/No. 240 overall).
The buzz: One of MSU’s earliest commitments, Gillison is an athletic pass-catching tight end who has Jimmy Graham-like skills and speed. He also played defense in high school, another versatile football player in a class full of them.
Xavier Henderson also reportedly had scholarship offers from Kentucky, Mississippi and Wisconsin, among others.

DB Xavier Henderson
School: Pickerington (Ohio) Central
Vitals: 6-0, 185
247Composite rating: 4 stars (No. 14 ATH/No. 304 overall).The buzz: Another expected early enrollee was MSU’s first commitment, even before the 3-9 season in 2016. Henderson is a play-maker — likely at safety in college — who also shined on special teams and at running back in high school.
