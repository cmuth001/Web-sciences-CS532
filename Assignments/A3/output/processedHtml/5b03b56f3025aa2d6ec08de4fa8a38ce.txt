The 23-year-old Greece international is in Nottingham and is set to have a medical ahead of the planned deal.
Kapino was previously at Olympiakos but had not played since a 3-2 loss to AEK on September 24 and his contract was terminated after the January window.
Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis will be well aware of Kapino's abilities because he also owns Olympiakos.
