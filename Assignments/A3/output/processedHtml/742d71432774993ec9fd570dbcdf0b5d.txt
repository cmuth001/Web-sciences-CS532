2017/18 Special Edition Stadium Kit
AIK
£81.95
AIK has earned their status from the start. Over a century in the making, their historic away kit pays homage to their strong beginning.With only a small number produced and delivered in a special box, it’s a collector’s item in the making.
DESIGN DETAILS
The away shirt is a tribute to the 1900 kit that lifted the club’s first Swedish league title—the first of two back-to-back championships. The new kit revives the original lettering of “AIK” across the chest—the same as the 1900 shirt.
AIK’s badge was the result of a competition for a new club logo. Fritz Carlsson-Carlings’s design won the contest in 1898 and was later voted the most beautiful crest in football. The crest’s towers, modelled after Stockholm’s walls, represent tradition. The strength of AIK is shown in the sash across the shield, while the club’s value of Glory is depicted in the Sol Invictus (“Invincible Sun”) in the upper-left.
CLUB STORY
The Public Athlete Club (Allmänna Idrottsklubben) was founded in 1891 by brothers Isidor and Paul Behrens, with a vision of glory. With the supreme confidence to chase greatness, idling is unacceptable for the club. Dedicated supporters have cheered AIK to 11 domestic titles and 8 Swedish cups and the club now sits confidently at the top of Swedish football.
