After PSV’s win earlier in the night, Ajax needed a victory to prevent them from slipping ten points behind the leaders, but before the second minute they found themselves behind. Andre Onana and Joel Veltman misjudged a cross and that allowed Simon Gustafson to fire into an empty net at the back post.
The lead only lasted ten minutes before Donny van de Beek was left completely free to sweep the ball into the net from around the penalty spot to make it 1-1. Hakim Ziyech then turned the game on its head with a stunning strike into the top corner on 25 minutes to put Ajax in front.
Ajax got off to a sluggish start in the second half but they eventually added a third goal in the 71st minute when Van de Beek set Klaas Jan Huntelaar in on goal and the striker calmly rounded Hidde Jurjus before slotting in.
Roda JC made it exciting with ten minutes to go as Jorn Vancamp slotted in a pass from Maecky Ngombo. However, straight from the kick-off, Ajax went forward and Huntelaar netted his second of the game from Nicolas Tagliafico’s cross to seal the victory for the visitors.
Ajax remain seven points behind PSV at the top while Roda JC are 16th.
