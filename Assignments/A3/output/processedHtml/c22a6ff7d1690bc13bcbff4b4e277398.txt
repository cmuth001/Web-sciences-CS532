On Wednesday, running back Dante Black made his pact with UConn official as he signed his National Letter of Intent to the Huskies. He initially committed in January.
A native of Snellville, GA, Black is rated as a 3-star prospect by Rivals. Listed a 5-foot-11, 200 pounds, the running back held offers from eight FBS schools, most notably Army, Air Force and Tulane.
Despite playing just three games during his senior year at Brookwood High School, he ran for 384 rushing yards on just 70 carries, good for 5.5 yards-per-carry.
He joins quarterback Steve Krajewski as the second Georgia player in UConn’s class of 2018. Former UConn star RB Donald Brown offered some insight into what Black brings to the table.
