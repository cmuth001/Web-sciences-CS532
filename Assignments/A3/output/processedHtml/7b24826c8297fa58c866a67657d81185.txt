In football everything is complicated by the presence of the opposite team. ~ Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre
Often youâll hear football being referred to as the beautiful game. Itâs such a phenomenon that two Harvard professors have even started a class asking students to explain why football is called the beautiful game.
A passionate commentator explains the passion of football, alludes to the roar of the crowd and the noise of the people. What a skilled player can do with the ball is unthinkable, impossible, making it all the more beautiful. A succession of passes leading to an easy goal is beautiful; everything about the game is simply beautiful.
But what really makes it the beautiful game is the fact that it takes people from thousands of different countries, cultures, and dialects, and brings them together under one simple language: football.
