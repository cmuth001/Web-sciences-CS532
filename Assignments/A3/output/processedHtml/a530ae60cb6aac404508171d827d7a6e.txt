Manchester United are reportedly willing to pay £45m to sign Fabinho from Monaco and are confident of getting a deal over the line.
Red Devils boss Jose Mourinho strengthened his attacking ranks in January with the addition of Alexis Sanchez and is now focusing on his midfield and defence.
Versatile Brazil international Fabinho, who can cover at both right-back and defensive midfield, is said to be among Mourinho's top targets ahead of next season.
United had been tipped to make a move for the 24-year-old last month, but instead focused solely on bringing Sanchez to the club from top-flight rivals Arsenal.
According to respected Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio , however, United will now go all out to land Fabinho for what they feel is a bargain price.
There are suggestions that discussions are already at an early stage between the two clubs, but other interested parties - Paris Saint-Germain among them - are expected to make themselves known.
