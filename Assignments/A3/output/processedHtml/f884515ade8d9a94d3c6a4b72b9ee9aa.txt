Poch was a little too honest and open in this interview, and couldn't pick a worse timing, that's for sure.
With that being said - I doubt there's a single manager out there who actually discourages his players to dive, if they're good. Mourinho, Conte, Pep, Klopp, etc. They're not as naive to talk like this in public. But the truth is, under the current laws of the game, diving is too beneficial. It can win you games, and worst case you'll get a yellow card - it's fairly rare, and for an attacking player getting a yellow is no big deal.
If they really want to fight diving, they need to change the rules and the punishment. Make it a red card offence, give serious, frequent retrospective bans. Only then will players actually stop diving.
This current idea of 'making it really beneficial but expect people not to do it because of moral reasons' is always a bit naive.
