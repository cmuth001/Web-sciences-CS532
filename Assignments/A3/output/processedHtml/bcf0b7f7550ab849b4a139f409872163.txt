Arsenal target Lautaro Martinez has confirmed he has held talks with Inter Milan sporting director Piero Ausilio over a move to the Italian giants.
The Racing Club striker is on both Arsenal and Inter's radar ahead of the summer transfer window after impressing in Argentina.
Inter are believed to be at the front of the queue, though, and latest reports claim he has agreed a â‚¬20.2million deal to move to the San Siro.
Martinez is said to have signed a deal until 2023 with Inter, and the 20-year-old has revealed he has held talks with the club.
"I met Ausilio and he told me about Inter," Martinez told Ole.
"He told me things that I'd already heard from [former Inter Milan strike Diego] Milito.
"My future? I'm happy to stay at Racing for now. Negotiations between the two clubs are for my agent.
"I'm definitely staying here until June, so I can't afford to think of anything else."
