The Future Of Ohio State Football Might Be Brighter Than Ever
The Buckeyes aren’t going anywhere.
The last two Ohio State football seasons have ended in somewhat of a disappointment.
In 2016, the Buckeyes got whacked by Clemson in one of the most lob-sided games in Ohio State history
In 2017, Ohio State won the Big Ten and the Cotton Bowl, but missed out on the College Football Playoff
Fear not, though, Ohio State fans. The future of this program is maybe brighter than it’s ever been.
Today proved this. Here’s what happened:
Ohio State finalized its 2018 recruiting class, which ranks No. 2 in the country (and would be No. 1 if not for Georgia’s historic class)
Urban Meyer announced that he will soon sign an extension that adds several years to his contract
Greg Schiano pledged his loyalty to the program, announcing he wouldn’t be leaving for the New England Patriots

This all comes a couple of weeks after several Ohio State underclassmen announced they’d be returning for 2018. Star offensive players like Mike Weber, Johnnie Dixon and Parris Campbell, among others, will be back.
J.T. Barrett is gone, but the Buckeyes will bring back basically everyone else on offense, and the quarterback competition will feature three talented guys in Dwayne Haskins, Joe Burrow and Tate Martell.
Ohio State will enter the 2018 season with College Football Playoff and national title aspirations. The Buckeyes are a unanimous top-five team in the preseason top 25s.
It’s looking like Ohio State will continue to sit on its Big Ten throne while competing for championships for a while longer.
