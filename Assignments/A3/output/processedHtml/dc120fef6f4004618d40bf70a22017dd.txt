As a neutral ,I think Tottenham need to cut out the diving and cheating ,but well played to Newport for getting a replay at Wembley,it was always going to be tough.

Spurs must be the most wasteful team ever in front goal.  Poch needs to recognise this.  Son gets lots of praise but he does miss lots of chances along with Ali

Halleluiah, it’s a miracle; Lamela the player who suffered a life altering injury on Sunday and had to be airlifted from the field has made a full recovery, Thanks and praise to the baby Jesus.  CHEAT…………….

Quite a strong Spurs team but only 2-0? Were they blindfolded?

 @20  Yeah, about as neutral as phosphoric acid. We have to suffer cr@p decisions every week. Over the years is cost us countless points and Christ knows how many millions.But instead of moaning about it for almost a week, we accept it and get on with our lives. Try it , might help your blood pressure.

Spurs were pretty awful tonight. Llorente is a waste of money and no better than Vincent Janssen, who they should have persevered with. Lamela was Robbie Savage's MotM but when a simple ball is on, he rarely plays it and he never gives the team any width. Eriksen is a much smarter player. Sissoko is a great athlete, but would have been expensive at £15m, never mind £30m. Frustrating to watch.

Thoroughly expected outcome tonight, but such a shame for Newport that they didn't hold on to win the original tie. The game meant so much more to them than it could ever mean to anyone at Spurs.   The sad reality of the Premier League nowadays is that the financial divide between the 'haves' and the 'have nots' is far, far too big.

Carry on cheating, disgraceful statement.

Dear me - what’s with this cheating rubbish. Spurs are one of the best sides to watch.

Well played Newport for keeping it at 2. Hopefully the finances will allow them to build - as they will for my team, Rochdale. The Brazilians can play on sand and so can Rochdale, apparently. I hope the pitch will be better but they haven't exactly got the finances to fix it. I don't think we'll win but I hope we give them a good game. Up the dale!
70. True Shrew bbc 0707/02/2018 22:31:54
@ 42.  39 Pontiac Dream  Good luck in the next round, great win for Rochdale last night by the way.

Newport put up more fight than the Woolwich exiles will do on Saturday.

Always loved the way Pochetino encouraged young players but what is going on recently. Even against second division opposition they falling over. It's killing the game all this. I include  my teams Stirling and Zaha plus others. But today Poch says it's okay
2. Ottoman bbc 333407/02/2018 21:43:42
Good to see Alderweireld return.  Llorente should of scored two, looks devoid of confidence.  Lamela deserved MOTM  Bring on the Scum!

Let’s be honest, they should really have beaten Newport without needing a replay.
50. Spurs bbc 8707/02/2018 22:20:25
Well done Spurs. Tricky tie. Newport gave it their all... It's a shame the salty tears are still flowing for some. Tut, tut. Grow a pair and move on. Like girl's constantly b*tching. No wonder women have more balls than some men the way they cry.
51. Zaphod bbc 51907/02/2018 22:21:26
Ignoring some of the previous moronic posts.  I would like to say, I am pleased that we go through to the next round (obviously).  But well played Newport, they gave it a good go and never gave up. Newport fans you should be very proud of your team. Good luck for the rest of the season.  P.S. If Llorente had a banjo a cows behind would be in no danger at all...
52. Fencesitter bbc 71807/02/2018 22:21:36
If ever a HYS was a waste of time, this is it; immediately jumped on by the usual Arsenal and Spurs muppets who just want to trade insults. Why not back off occasionally and give someone else a voice, like the fans of Newport, for example? So far in this thread, you've all proved yourselves utter plonkers.

Well done Newport! No shame in result to a bunch of overpaid, cheating, prima donnas. Only real football is played by lower league teams, the PL is a corrupt disgrace!
55. Mike bbc 16407/02/2018 22:21:56
If these lower league teams want to play in the Fa cup , at least make some sort of effort  1 corner 1 shot both coming in 2nd half injury time
