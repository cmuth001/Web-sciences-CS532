England Release Their Kits Ahead Of The World Cup
Powered by
England have revealed their kits for the World Cup and they are very, very snazzy.
It's fair to say that Nike's designs and templates over the last couple of years haven't exactly gone down well but the latest England strips are proving very popular.
WATCH: The 10 greatest football kits in history:
The Three Lions have reverted to the traditional home colours, with white and a hint of red on the collar and the squad numbers, as well as a blue Nike swoosh, teamed with navy blue sorts containing a red trim, and complete with white socks.
As for the away kit, it takes inspiration from the famous 1966 red kit that Sir Alf Ramsey's side wore when they beat West Germany on home soil to lift the World Cup for the first and only time.
A further nod to history comes in the form of the fact that both kits contain an English rose, St.George's cross and the traditional Three Lions crest.
England stars Raheem Sterling, Marcus Rashford, Joe Gomez, Harry Kane, Kyle Walker and John Stones were all involved in the promotion shoot for the kits.
As good as the simple but smart home and away kits are though, the new training kit inspired by what England wore in the 1982 World Cup in Spain, has stole the show - and should really be the home kit for the showpiece in Russia if you ask me.
Here's how fans have been reacting to the kits, with the general consensus that they are straight fire:
The home kit will be worn for the first time on home soil by the men's senior team in the friendly against Italy on March 27th.
