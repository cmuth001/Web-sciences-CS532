FRED SPIKSLEY: A FLAWED FOOTBALL GENIUS
Lionel Messi may be following in the footsteps of George Best and Best in the footsteps of Stanley Matthews and Tom Finney. But all of these legends followed in the footsteps of Fred Spiksley - and none of them can lay claim to being chased along the touchline by the future Queen of England whilst scoring the first ever hat-trick against Scotland.
 
And how many footballers can say that after winning every honour in the game they shared a stage with Charlie Chaplin and escaped from a prison camp in Germany at the outbreak of WW1. Fred Spiksley did all of those things and much more.
 
Fred was professional football’s first entertainer and it’s time for the world to rediscover a forgotten legend.
