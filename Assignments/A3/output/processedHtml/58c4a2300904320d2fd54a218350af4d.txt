Eddie Jackson had strong words for a critic who questioned an NFL combine invite for former Alabama defensive back Anthony Averett.
On Tuesday, it was learned that the Crimson Tide had 14 former players invited to the NFL combine , which is a prime opportunity for prospects to showcase their skills before scouts, coaches and executives before the NFL draft. One of those invites belongs to Averett, who had 98 tackles with 1 interception from 2015-17 with Alabama.
Justin Nails, a writer for Gridiron Now, wrote on Twitter that Averett’s NFL combine invitation was a “head scratcher,” and Nails questioned whether Averett could be a player at the next level. Jackson, who had 126 tackles with 9 interceptions as a defensive back with the Crimson Tide from 2013-16 before the Chicago Bears took him in the fourth round of the 2017 NFL Draft, didn’t care for that piece of commentary.
Check out Jackson’s response below:
That’s quite the message from Jackson, who drove his point home with the “Disrespectful” hashtag.
There’s something to his thought, though. It’s early in the pre-draft process, so perhaps Averett can benefit from a strong showing at the NFL combine. Jackson should understand what it takes to succeed in the NFL, after totaling 73 tackles with 2 interceptions as part of Chicago’s secondary last season.
