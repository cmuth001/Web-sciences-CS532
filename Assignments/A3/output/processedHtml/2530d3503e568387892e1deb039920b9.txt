Troy Deeney has been sent off once this season and accepted a separate violent conduct charge
Watford's Troy Deeney will not face any formal action after his middle-finger gesture in Monday's win over Chelsea.
Footage of Deeney's goal celebration was referred to a panel of three former match officials by the Football Association.
However, they were not unanimous over whether it was a red card offence so no disciplinary action will be taken.
The FA will issue a written warning to Deeney, 29, who said his actions were a response to "transfer speculation".
"I've kept quiet because I realise talking gets me in trouble" he added. "That was a case of letting everyone know I saw everything and I am still here."
Deeney had faced a ban of up to four matches after receiving two red cards already this season. The Watford captain accepted a violent conduct charge and a three-match suspension after clashing with Stoke's Joe Allen in October.
The striker was then given a four-game ban having lost an appeal against the red card he received for a challenge on Huddersfield's Collin Quaner in December.
Fifa gave Dele Alli a one-match suspension and a Â£3,800 fine for making a middle-finger gesture earlier this season.
The Tottenham midfielder claimed his gesture was aimed at England team-mate Kyle Walker and not at match officials.
