Welcome to the Rise of the Robins. we will attempt to take Altrincham FC in FM18 all the way from the Evo-Stik Premier League to the actual Premier League in Football Manager 2018.
This is LLM (lower league management) at its finest. it's going to be a long tough challenge, we need to keep an eye on finances, and build a new bright future for the club. I have been hired as the official Altrincham Football Manager Manager so let's not get sacked in our first season!
