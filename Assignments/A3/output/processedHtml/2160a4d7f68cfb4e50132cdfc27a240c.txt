Support Konkani
Hello Radio Goa listeners,
It’s a challenge for us to run a regional commercial-free, a listener-supported radio station in today’s economic environment. Radio Goa rely entirely on you to keep on the air. So please, make the effort to support Radio Goa.
Our website is entirely listener-supported and independent radio, that means we rely entirely on your support for our operational budget.
We hope that our music provides you with enjoyment, and we hope you’ll offer a little something back our way to finance our continued operation. You can simply make a one-time donation, or sign up for an automatic monthly payment.
If you can’t donate, it’s alright you can still help us by sharing our page on your social media pages.
Dev Borem korum.
