This weekend, the Florida Gators are hosting the first of three significant official visitor weekends over the run-up to National Signing Day in February.
It has already yielded a commitment.
That one has come from 2018 wide receiver Justin Watkins, who is one of this weekend’s official visitors, and publicly joined the Gators’ class on Saturday night with the release of this tweet.

Watkins, who hails from Clermont and attended East Ridge High School, is rated the No. 115 player and No. 21 wide receiver in the class of 2018 by the 247Sports Composite rankings. He was also an Under Armour All-America Game participant, and his highlights show a dynamic player who could be a good wide receiver at the collegiate level — but it’s also possible he could end up on the other side of the ball, given that he’s considered as much of an athlete as a wide receiver at the moment.
Watkins is Florida’s 15th commitment for the 2018 recruiting class, now ranked No. 15 by the 247Sports Composite team rankings. He is one of just two commits — offensive lineman Richard Gouraige is the other — not already enrolled at Florida or bound to the school by a National Letter of Intent.
But while Watkins could theoretically flip to another program between now and then, it is far more likely that this is the end of his recruitment, and that he’ll sign with the Gators come February.
