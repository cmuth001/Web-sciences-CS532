Social media and persistent recruiting helped The Citadel land a couple of running backs Wednesday that are ranked among the top 100 in the nation by ESPN, Bulldogs coach Brent Thompson said Wednesday
Three-star running backs Clay Harris of Atlanta and Emeka Nwanze of Johns Creek, Ga., were among the 17 players in the 2018 recruiting class announced by The Citadel on National Signing Day.
The Citadel also added a quarterback when Javonte Middleton of Jenkins High School in Savannah, Ga., signed his letter of intent Wednesday afternoon. Middleton (6-0, 165) is rated a two-star prospect by 24/7 Sports and reportedly had offers from Army and Savannah State.
Middleton was named the top player in Chatham County after leading his team to a 12-1 record. He passed for 2,098 yards with 17 touchdowns, and rushed for 550 yards and 11 scores.
"The Citadel felt like home to me," Middleton told reporters at his signing day ceremony. "My biggest thing was not about the athletic program, because every school that offered me had a good athletics program and football team. I wanted to go to a place that had a degree that would be respected in the workplace once I graduate."
Harris (6-0, 203) is ranked No. 48 by ESPN among high school senior running backs, with Nwanze (6-0, 215) at No. 91. Both had early offers from FBS schools, including some in the ACC, SEC and Big Ten.
But when those plans didn't work out, The Citadel emerged as a viable option because Bulldog coaches had never stopped recruiting them, Thompson said.
"It was persistence that landed them both," Thompson said. "It was similar stories, really, two highly touted running backs and for one reason or another, things didn't pan out the way they thought they might.
"We just tracked their progress, and these days Twitter allows you to do that. Probably in years past, we might have moved on because they had a bunch of FBS offers. But Coach (Blake) Harrell did a great job of minding both those guys, and we just stayed with them."
Assistant coach Charles Hopkins also helped recruit both players, and Thompson paid each an in-home visit.
"I took a home visit with both of them on a Sunday right after an official visit," Thompson said. "I was not sure we'd still be in the mix. But we found out in mid-January they were still available, and we took a hard run at them. I'm just happy to get them, and that nobody plucked them from us."
For comparison's sake, the running backs ranked just above and below Harris signed with Louisville and Oregon State; the backs just above and below Nwanze signed with Temple and North Carolina State.
A two-time all-county pick at Norcross High School, Harris ran for 504 yards and seven touchdowns on 118 carries as a senior. He could play fullback or slotback in The Citadel's triple option, Thompson said.
"He's versatile and can play both positions depending on our needs," Thompson said. "He starts and stops and explodes with great acceleration. He can do some great things for us."
Nwanze ran for 1,257 yards and eight touchdowns on 216 carries as a senior, averaging 104.8 yards per game over 12 games.
The Citadel's class included only one player from South Carolina, defensive back Von Ramsey of Greenwood. Last year, the Bulldogs signed nine in-state players.
"We took a couple of cuts on in-state players and didn't get them," Thompson said. "Sometimes that happens. It's a little bit of a concern for me, but The Citadel is not an easy decision to make.
"When you take as many cuts as we did, you are going to get turned down sometimes, and that's okay. But we have five coaches committed to recruiting in the state, and we put out a bunch of offers."
The Bulldogs' class includes a pair of rangy defensive ends in Mason Kinsey (6-2, 228) of Arlington, Texas, and Marquise Blount (6-3, 223) of Charlotte. There are five defensive backs, two linebackers, four running backs, two offensive linemen and kicker/punter Matt Campbell of Dacula, Ga.
West Ashley defensive lineman Jay Smith, an All-Lowcountry pick, will walk-on at The Citadel, according to Wildcats coach Bobby Marion.
