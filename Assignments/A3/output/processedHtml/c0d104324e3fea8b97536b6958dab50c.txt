Tom Herman 's first complete recruiting cycle at Texas has finished towards the top of 247Sports 2018 Team Rankings, and included a haul in historic fashion inside state lines.
The Longhorns signed 11 of the Top 15 prospects in the Lone Star State according to the 247Sports Composite rankings, which has never happened in the modern era of Internet recruiting coverage.

Herman and his staff have received a lot of praise for the momentous 2018 class, especially considering his first season in Austin did not end with the best record.
The second-year head coach made it clear this type of recruiting effort, particularly in the state of Texas, is not an anomaly.
"11 out of the Top 15 players in the state of Texas signed with the University of Texas," Herman said during his National Signing Day press conference.
"I said it (after the early signing period) and I'll say it again, that needs to not be an aberration. It needs to be the new normal."
Up until Wednesday, Texas signed a total of 12 Top 15 prospects in the state of Texas over the last four recruiting classes. Herman understands the importance of dominating the state's recruiting battles in order for Texas to return prominence.
"When this place was winning championships on a regular basis, that's the way it was," he said.
"We know we've got to do a great job in our state, and our bordering states—mainly Oklahoma and Louisiana—to make sure the bulk of our roster is that."
Texas current sits with the No. 3 ranked signing class in 2018 Team Rankings.
