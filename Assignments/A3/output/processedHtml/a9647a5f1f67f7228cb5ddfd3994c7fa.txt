Tributes have been paid to long-standing Rossington Main president Gerald Murden who died at the weekend aged 86.
Main chairman Carl Stokes described ‘Gerry’ as ‘one of non-league football’s great characters’.
“Gerald was fondly called Gerry by all who knew him,” said Carl. “He would be seen down at our Oxford Street ground, not missing any of the matches until recent ill health restricted his attendance.
“Gerry would also be a regular down at the Rossington Miners Welfare club on a Thursday night for the weekly letter draw.
“What will live in the memories of most would be Gerry running and serving behind the Tea cabin down at Main during each first and second team game.
“He will be remembered as a Rossington Main legend and one of non-league football’s great characters.
“Our thoughts go out to all his friends and family. He will be deeply missed. RIP Gerry.”
Assistant boss Lee Holmes tweeted: “One of our own and one of the best thanks for everything RIP Gerry”
Coach Andy Cowe tweeted: “Smashing bloke who will be sorely missed. RIP, legend.”
