"With the 25th pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, the Tennessee Titans select: Dallas Goedert , tight end, from South Dakota State ." Those are the words Roger Goodell will speak if Todd McShay's latest NFL Mock Draft is correct.

It's a few spots higher than McShay's first mock , which sent the SDSU product to the Pittsburgh Steelers with the then-No. 31 pick. Now, with the draft order fully set and the NFL season behind us, McShay likes the tight end leaving the board at No. 25.
Here's what he says about the pick:
"It isn't a terrific tight end group this year, but Goedert is the best one in this class. He's still a little underrated and didn't get a chance to shine in the Senior Bowl, as he was injured on the first day of practice. You don't get too many two-way TEs coming out of college, but Goedert fits the bill. He's got a big frame (6-4, 260) with good speed and can play in-line or detached. He's another good, young weapon for Marcus Mariota ."
Goedert would give Mariota, as McShay noted, another young weapon. Corey Davis , Taywan Taylor and Jonnu Smith are all 23 or younger, with veterans like tight end Delanie Walker and wide receivers  Eric Decker , Rishard Matthews and Harry Douglas in the room.
Goedert's blocking abilities would go a long way as well in Tennessee's two-headed rushing attack of Demarco Murray and Derrick Henry , assuming all pieces return next season.
In this mock, Goedert is the first tight end off of the board, four picks in front of South Carolina tight end Hayden Hurst ( Jacksonville ).
