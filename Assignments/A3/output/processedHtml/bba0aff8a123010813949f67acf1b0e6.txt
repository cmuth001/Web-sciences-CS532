Nike Launch the Mercurial Vapor 360
07 February 2018
Nike's next-generation of lo-cut lethal speed comes in the form of the Mercurial Vapor 360 as it drops in to co-pilot the Superfly into a World Cup year of Swoosh styled innovation.
Nike's summer showpiece drops in an explosion of Mercurial mayhem as the Swoosh arrive in 2018 town with reloaded weaponry to fire up World Cup hype. The Mercurial Vapor sits closer than ever to the Superfly as Nike introduce their 360 degree construction to the upper of the iconic speed series. It's simply a choice of collar or no collar this time around.
That 360 degree construction eliminates any excess space inside the boot by locking your foot in and preventing any slip within the boot. In turn maximising a players top speed. Ribbed Flyknit features on the upper to provide an added bit of precision touch when controlling the ball at pace.
Visually, the Mercurial Vapor 360 screams fast with a stunning streamline aesthetic and bold "Total Orange" launch colourway. Re-positioned Swooshes and the introduction of the 'M' logo on the heel bring refreshed graphic game, but it's all about the exquisite soleplate down below. 
The claw-like soleplate is inspired by the Cheetah paw – an aggressive forefoot is built for acceleration in any direction while the heel studs help the player stop on a dime. Fast enough? All Nike players will wear the Mercurial Vapor 360 and  Mercurial Superfly 360 on-pitch from this weekend onwards.
