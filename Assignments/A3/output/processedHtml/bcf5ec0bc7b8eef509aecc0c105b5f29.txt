England have unveiled their World Cup 2018 kit - in classic white and red
The home jersey has gone for a classic look, with a white shirt, with red trim blue shorts and white socks.
Meanwhile, the FA and the American sportswear giant have gone for a two-tone red, a colour immortalised by Geoff Hurst and Co in 1966, for the away strip.
And that includes a stylish tonal graphic of the St George's Cross.
According to the official description, "the two-tone stripes evoke speed to reflect the youthful wave of talent that is taking over English football and culture."

That will be worn with white shorts, which includes an England crest, and red socks.
Both tops also feature a rosette on the inside of them, which is reference to the rose on the caps awarded to players for each appearance they make for the country.
Gareth Southgate will lead his squad to Russia in June in the aim of lifting the World Cup for the first time in 52 years.
A host of young stars have the nation's hopes on their shoulders - including the likes of Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Dele Alli and Marcus Rashford.

But despite the relative inexperience within Southgate's camp, Nike says "the need to produce an identifiably English collection was at the heart" of the design.
Pete Hoppins, Nike Football Apparel Senior Design Director, said: "Our goal was to create a range of products that even without an England crest or Nike Swoosh, would still instantly look like an England collection.
"That classic identity, with a modern edge added, is imperative to the whole collection."

A special custom typeface will also be used for player names with the "quintessentially English fonts" Johnston and Gil Sans both being chosen.
And in an attempt to give our stars an extra advantage, even the numbers that will don the front of the shirts have been given specialist treatment.
Not only have they been moved from the centre to just below the crest, they are "backed by anti-cling nodes because athletes mentioned that previous number applications had caused the shirt to stick to their backs during extreme heat," according to the manufacturers.

The nation, players and Southgate are all hoping to be in Russia for the full seven-week period it will take to emerge triumphant.
And during their time away from the matches they will be decked out in the training gear, which was also revealed today.
From tailored Nike Sportswear Tech Fleece tracksuits to a pure white Anthem Jacket, they will not be found wanting for anything proudly showing off the Three Lions badge.
The last England World Cup kit was released prior to the 2014 tournament.
