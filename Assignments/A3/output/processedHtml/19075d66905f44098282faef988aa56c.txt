Over the last four months I’ve been working with Argos as part of the Chad Valley Play Panel. Our twin girls have been very lucky that they’ve been sent some lovely toys to test out so that we can share our findings with you on our blog.
This month we’re reviewing some of the new additions to the Chad Valley range for 2018, plus we have our final competition to win a £75 Argos voucher.
First up, we have a review of our latest toy. As part of the Chad Valley Play Panel team we received the Chad Valley 3ft Football Games Table . It costs £54.99 and is a great, sturdy games table.
Our twin girls are almost six years old and they’re the perfect height for this table. It’s not too big that it takes over your entire house, it’s just the right size for children.
At 3ft tall, adults can play too by kneeling down. I’ve played this game a lot with our children, and believe me, it’s so much fun!
You do have to put it together yourself, but it only took half an hour. The instructions were easy to follow and all of the parts needed are included. It also comes with two footballs.
The handles have soft grips and they’re easy for children to hold and move. At either end of the football table you’ll find a slot where you can collect the football from once a goal has been scored.
There’s also a score board. Children can move one slider to the end of the table with each goal that’s scored. Who will get to 10 first?
This really is a fantastic football table. It’s well made, lots of fun and our girls love it!
