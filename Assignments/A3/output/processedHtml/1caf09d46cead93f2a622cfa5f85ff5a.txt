Banbury started well and went ahead in the eighth minute when a fierce Tom Winters free-kick from 20 yards saw Colm McAdden only able to knock the shot away to the incoming Luke Carnell who fired the ball home from the edge of the six yard box.
United would have much the better of the remainder of the half and went close to extending their lead on a couple of occasions. In the 27th minute a cross in from the left by Tom Bradbury went through to Ricky Johnson on the penalty spot who controlled the ball and did well to turn sharply and make room for a shot, only for him to be unfortunate to see his effort go inches wide of the post. The in the 38th minute Self passed the ball through to Johnson down the left inside the Basingstoke penalty area but the United striker’s shot was pushed away by McAdden around the post for a corner.
So though having dominated the half, United had just the one goal lead to show for this at the interval.
The second half was a different story with Basingstoke having the better of proceedings. They went close to equalising after just two minutes when Sam Argent was put through on goal down the centre but his lob from the edge of the penalty area, under pressure from Bradbury, over Jack Harding in the Banbury goal went wide.
Basingstoke would go on to have much the better of the second half though they didn't create many chances. In the 65th minute a 30 yard free-kick from George Bennett went a few feet over the bar but there was little to trouble Harding.
Banbury offered little going forward in the second half, there only real opportunity coming in the 80th minute when a Winters free-kick from the left saw a glancing header from Carnell go just wide.
But Basingstoke got their reward for their second half efforts six minutes from time when Tim Wohlfiel crossed from the right to the incoming Ben Wright down the left who shot from a narrow angle 12 yards out across Harding into the far bottom corner of the net to earn the visitors a point that there second half efforts deserved.
For Banbury a decent first half performance but a most lack-lustre second half showing.
