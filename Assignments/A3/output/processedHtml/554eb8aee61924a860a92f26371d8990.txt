FULL TIME: Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 Newport County
And that’s that! Spurs are through to the fifth round in a fuss-free manner. They didn’t put on a show, but then they didn’t have to. Newport put in a decent performance, and their pride remains intact. But all of the drama was played out at Rodney Parade. No matter, as their fans celebrate anyway. They made it to Wembley in the FA Cup , after all!
