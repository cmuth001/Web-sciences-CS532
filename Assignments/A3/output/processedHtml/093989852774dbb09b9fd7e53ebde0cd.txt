One of Penn State’s key defenders will be back on the practice field this spring. John Reid, a senior cornerback who missed all of last season with a serious knee injury, will be a “full go” during the spring, James Franklin said Wednesday.
John Reid a ‘full go’ for Penn State in spring practice
James Franklin expects CB John Reid to be a "full go" for spring camp after missing 2017 season. Thinks he'll play a big role as both a player and leader in 2018.

Reid was ruled out of the 2017 season after getting hurt last April. The starting cornerback was an honorable mention All-Big Ten selection in 2016 as he helped Penn State win the Big Ten. A Philadelphia native, Reid made 36 tackles (5 for loss), had 1 interception and also returned punts for the Nittany Lions in 2016.
Reid opened up about his season on the sidelines in an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer at the Fiesta Bowl.
“Outside of me not playing, I still feel like I was really involved with everything,” Reid said. “They kept me involved entirely. I told them I was really appreciative of that because when you get hurt … you almost feel like you have a falling out.
“But here, I was really grateful they kept me very involved. The only thing that wasn’t happening was, I wasn’t playing. That [stinks]. But I was really grateful for the way they treated me.”
