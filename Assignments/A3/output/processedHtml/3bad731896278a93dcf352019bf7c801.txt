Alabama may not rule college football recruiting with a No. 1 class anymore , but that doesn't mean coach Nick Saban is suddenly a slouch. The Crimson Tide are still getting plenty of talent. 
The latest win for Alabama is four-star wide receiver Jaylen Waddle out of Episcopal High School in Houston. Waddle is the No. 39 overall prospect, the No. 5 wide receiver recruit and the No. 3 recruit in Texas.
