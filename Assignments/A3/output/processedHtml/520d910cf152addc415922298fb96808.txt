Defensive back John Reid is expected to be back in action this spring after missing the 2017 season due to a torn ACL, Penn State coach James Franklin announced Wednesday afternoon.Â 
"We are expecting him to be full-go for spring ball," Franklin said on his National Signing Day teleconference. "He's participating in the morning workouts right now. Obviously there's no rush to bring him back. He's played a lot of football for us, but I know the coaches are excited about working with him. I know John is excited about getting back on the field."
The secondary will be improved with the addition of Reid, who started all 14 games in the 2016 season.
After a productive sophomore campaign, which included a number of accolades including an All-Big Ten honorable mention, Reid was expected to be a key contributor to the Penn State defense.
A leg injury during spring practice changed that.
Reid's absence gave then-freshman Tariq Castro-fields and Lamont Wade quality playing time. Chris Campbell and Grant Haley are heading to the NFL, making Reid's presence this season vital.
Reid will likely start alongside Amani Oruwariye, who had four interceptions last season.
