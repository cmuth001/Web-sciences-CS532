In Mauricio Pochettino’s 200th game in charge, Tottenham  took a big step towards a potential first trophy for the Argentine with a routine 2-0 win over Newport County to reach the FA Cup  fifth round.
It may have taken a replay at Wembley after the Welsh side were denied a famous giant-killing by Harry Kane, but with a trip to Rochdale next on the calendar, some at the club will have one eye on the quarter-finals already.
It wasn’t all plain sailing for Tottenham, though. Their League Two visitors started brightly and, with 7000 travelling fans backing them on a freezing night here at Wembley, were causing a strong Spurs side plenty of problems early on.
A stroke of misfortune for Mike Flynn’s side, though, saw Spurs in front. After Heung-min Son and the returning Danny Rose had gone close, it was an own goal that broke the deadlock.

Moussa Sissoko found space to square a ball from the right, though it needed no one on the end of it as Dan Butler’s heel turned the ball past a helpless Joe Day in the Newport goal. 
From there on Tottenham were in control and had no intention of letting the Exiles back in. The hosts pressed for a second and didn’t have to wait long. 
Son started off on another of his direct, dangerous runs before playing in Erik Lamela. The Argentine, slowly making his way back from over a year out, took a couple of neat touches before a calm finish saw him claim the first goal since his return.

The second half followed suit, with Spurs pressing a probing the Newport back four, while Day did well to stop Lamela claiming a second. 
Despite the introductions of Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli, the latter of which rattled the bar, Flynn’s side managed to keep the deficit to two, though Fernando Llorente squandered chances to bag just a third goal in Tottenham colours. 
The north London derby against Arsenal and the small matter of a trip to Turin for the Champions League last-16 first leg against Juventus now await for Pochettino.
While a win over a side from the fourth tier may pale into insignificance in the shadow of such ties, it could be a more than notable step on the way to a far superior landmark than 200 games, a first trophy.
