football difficult to watch. The rules are completely invented from scratch at the start of every contest. It stutters along with frantic, abrupt pauses that can last anywhere from an extremely long time to 600,000 hours. The players, in their matching capris and shiny plastic orbs, are virtually indistinguishable from one another, except those players with ponytails, who are merely indistinguishable from other players with ponytails. All of which is to say nothing of the hot shame you must, if you are in any way decent, feel as you watch the odds that these vigorous young men will be able to recognize the faces of their family members 20 years hence drop in real time as they patiently bash their precious brains in for your entertainment. The game is peppered with sudden silent moments where a person, having just collided at high speed with another person, lies motionless staring up toward the sky, or translucent ethylene tetrafluoroethylene ceiling, and all the thousands of people who, seconds ago, saw that man moving faster on his feet than they probably will, instinctively lean forward with dread-tensed stomachs and wonder if he will ever walk again.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>As an alternative to the bashing, the men can express <a href=\\"https://www.gq.com/story/colin-kaepernick-will-not-be-silenced\\">political dissent</a>, and become unemployed.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>However, against all reason and morality, we do love the Philadelphia Eagles, being, as they are, from Philadelphia.

If the Eagles did not win, my life would be faintly but palpably worse, at least for a period of a few hours. At the end of Super Bowl, there are 53 men on television who look like they&apos;ve just arrived home to find every single one of their possessions stolen, and 53 who are laughing, crying, dancing, and praying with delirious happiness. It was very important to me that on Sunday night the latter group would be the Philadelphia Eagles, but I had no desire to see the slog leading up to that point. I could go to sleep Sunday night at 6:30 P.M., wake up Monday morning to see the score, and be just as happy&#x2014;happier, probably&#x2014;than if I had been made to watch the entire game unfold.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Which is why my bosses thought it would be amusing to send me all the way to Minnesota in the middle of winter to watch the game in person.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>I know a haze when I see one, but I also know an opportunity for a scam.

I never knew something so loud could be so quiet. When Justin Timberlake commanded the crowd to hold their phones in the air, no one complied. Before the show, folks in my section had received detailed instructions about what to do with two mini flashlights placed at everyone&apos;s seats; few abided by them.

class="publish-date" data-reactid="130">February 6, 2018</time></div></div><p class="dek" data-reactid="131">Pennsylvania native Caity Weaver went on the Great Super Bowl Scavenger Hunt&#8212;and what transpired involved dark magic, hot dogs, and white devils.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="132"><p><strong>Many crisscrossing factors</strong> combine to make football difficult to watch. The rules are completely invented from scratch at the start of every contest. It stutters along with frantic, abrupt pauses that can last anywhere from an extremely long time to 600,000 hours. The players, in their matching capris and shiny plastic orbs, are virtually indistinguishable from one another, except those players with ponytails, who are merely indistinguishable from other players with ponytails. All of which is to say nothing of the hot shame you must, if you are in any way decent, feel as you watch the odds that these vigorous young men will be able to recognize the faces of their family members 20 years hence drop in real time as they patiently bash their precious brains in for your entertainment. The game is peppered with sudden silent moments where a person, having just collided at high speed with another person, lies motionless staring up toward the sky, or translucent ethylene tetrafluoroethylene ceiling, and all the thousands of people who, seconds ago, saw that man moving faster on his feet than they probably will, instinctively lean forward with dread-tensed stomachs and wonder if he will ever walk again.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="133"><p>As an alternative to the bashing, the men can express <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/colin-kaepernick-will-not-be-silenced">political dissent</a>, and become unemployed.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="134"><p>However, against all reason and morality, we do love the Philadelphia Eagles, being, as they are, from Philadelphia. And although I had never attended a football game before Super Bowl LII&#x2014;had never, that I can recall, even seen an entire game on TV&#x2014;I felt a desperate, primal need for the Eagles to win. If the Eagles did not win, my life would be faintly but palpably worse, at least for a period of a few hours. At the end of Super Bowl, there are 53 men on television who look like they&apos;ve just arrived home to find every single one of their possessions stolen, and 53 who are laughing, crying, dancing, and praying with delirious happiness. It was very important to me that on Sunday night the latter group would be the Philadelphia Eagles, but I had no desire to see the slog leading up to that point. I could go to sleep Sunday night at 6:30 P.M., wake up Monday morning to see the score, and be just as happy&#x2014;happier, probably&#x2014;than if I had been made to watch the entire game unfold.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="135"><p>Which is why my bosses thought it would be amusing to send me all the way to Minnesota in the middle of winter to watch the game in person.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="136"><p>I know a haze when I see one, but I also know an opportunity for a scam. I asked that, if I go, I be allowed an opportunity to win something of value to me, such as a <a href="http://www.nflshop.com/Philadelphia_Eagles_Gear/Philadelphia_Eagles_Refrigerated_Beverage_Center?p_src=dti">personal mini fridge emblazoned with the Eagles logo</a> for my cubicle in the office, retail value: $369.99.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="137"><p>And thus my Super Bowl Scavenger Hunt was born.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="138"><p>The terms of the hunt were thus: From a list of 25 items assembled by mysterious forces (a two-minute conversation with my co-workers), I must find or complete 13, representing one half of the list as well as the number of games the Eagles won during the 2017&#x2013;2018 season. The only stipulation was that the hunt must take place entirely within the confines of the Super Bowl.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="139"><p>Here was my scavenger hunt list.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="140"><p><strong>1.</strong> Diet Coke product<br>\n<strong>2.</strong> Bring home a handful of losing team&apos;s confetti<br>\n<strong>3.</strong> Hot dog 3 times<br>\n<strong>4.</strong> A personal story or previously unknown fact about Beyonc&#xE9;<br>\n<strong>5.</strong> Cast a spell on the Patriots to lose (procure items on site)<br>\n<strong>6.</strong> Get an Eagles fan to perform black magic with me<br>\n<strong>7.</strong> Earn money<br>\n<strong>8.</strong> Ride on a private plane<br>\n<strong>9.</strong> Sign someone up for <a href="http://delivery.com/">delivery.com</a> using my promo code so we both save $7<br>\n<strong>10.</strong> Take a selfie with Philadelphia boy Bradley Cooper (automatic scavenger hunt win if I thank him by saying, &quot;Thank you, Mr. McConaughey&quot;)<br>\n<strong>11.</strong> Get invited into a suite<br>\n<strong>12.</strong> Cheese steak + lobster roll (double points if consumed simultaneously)<br>\n<strong>13.</strong> <del>Find Jessica Biel</del> Make people think <em>GQ</em> employee A.

Two of them arrived in the lobby of our Minneapolis hotel wearing the kind of clothes you might to, say, watch a football game; the third, A. J. Gibbson (associate manager, social), entered wearing jeans, a belted suede Fendi trench coat with fur cuffs, a camel-colored Italian cashmere turtleneck, and cherry leather Chelsea boots, which had the immediate combined effect of making the rest of us look like his bumbling assistants. Upon seeing him, I petitioned my editor to modify an item on our scavenger hunt list: &quot;Find Jessica Biel&quot; became &quot;Make people think <em>GQ</em> employee A. J. Gibbson is more famous than Jessica Biel.&quot;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="148"><p>I found the first item on my list even before making it into the stadium, in a service elevator located in the media check-in area: a rogue Coca-Cola Company product at a Pepsi-sponsored event. A man in the elevator was carrying two cases of the brand&apos;s <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/new-diet-coke-flavors-review">alarmingly flavored new Diet Cokes</a>. Although these beverages were bound for the throats and stomachs of the elites, he allowed me to take a Diet Coke Feisty Cherry, and thank God he did, because I did not see another Coke product the entire time I was in Minneapolis. (An employee in our hotel restaurant explicitly informed me, &quot;Minnesota is a Pepsi state&quot;&#x2014;a gorgeous state motto.)</p></div><div class="component-lazy pending" data-component="Lazy" data-reactid="149"></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="150"><p>The part of the scavenger hunt I was most looking forward to, besides soaring over Minnesota in a private jet and making tons of celebrity friends in Bradley Cooper&apos;s stadium box, was &quot;hot dog three times.&quot; To check this item off the list, I would have to eat a hot dog three times. Not the same hot dog!</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="151"><p>I approached the nearest concession stand, and what to my wondering eyes should appear but a single menu item called &quot;TWO HOT DOGS.&quot; Although not hinted at in the name, &quot;TWO HOT DOGS&quot; consisted of two hot dogs <em>plus a side of fries,</em> for only $23, a price that included the cost associated with taking part in a living history experience in which customers learned firsthand what life was like during the Great Depression by paying $23 for two hot dogs. I decided to take a breather before my final hot dog, leaving that item temporarily unfinished.</p></div><div class="component-lazy pending" data-component="Lazy" data-reactid="152"></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="153"><p>Minnesota is the Land of 10,000 Lakes but they should call it the Land of 0,000 Lines. I&apos;d go back again just to not wait in the lines they don&apos;t have. The vast majority of the time&#x2014;at the freaking Super Bowl, with 67,612 people in attendance&#x2014;there weren&apos;t lines for the food stands, or the women&apos;s restrooms, or the incredible rollercoasters at the Mall of America, which I highly, highly, highly recommend. The people really are as friendly and helpful as you&apos;ve been warned about. The airport is filled with spry senior citizens armed with hypotheses about what holographic images printed on paper might do to the X-ray scanners (might &quot;set them off&quot; is the theory; &quot;not worth the risk&quot;).</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="154"><p>Here&apos;s the bad thing about Minnesota: The air is so ferociously cold and dry that you are liable to crack open and bleed simply from the strain of being. And so it was, with cuticles ripping violently apart, that I completed a second task from my list: receive medical attention.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="155"><p>While I was receiving my Band-Aid, another woman walked in with the complaint that some part of her body &quot;wouldn&apos;t stop bleeding.&quot; Come to Minnesota, a Pepsi state where you can&apos;t stop bleeding. The first aid station contained a robust supply of ibuprofen, Tums, and syringes.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="156"><p><strong>Item No. 20:</strong> Receive medical attention.

A kindly self-identified witch I know tried to dissuade me from performing this stunt, on the grounds that &quot;ethically, curses are tricky,&quot; but at the end of the day I had to follow my black heart.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="161"><p>Prior to my arrival, I pictured myself efficiently gathering my spell ingredients like a lonely old woman from days of yore whom everyone in town suspects of being a witch, but it turns out...yes, she is a witch.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="162"><p>Here was the list of necessaries for &quot;Bad Luck,&quot; per the source of my magic text, spellsofmagic.com:</p></div><div class="embed ul" data-reactid="163"><ul>\n<li>tape</li>\n<li>a pen</li>\n<li>paper</li>\n<li>1 piece of mint (optional)</li>\n<li>1 3-leaf clover</li>\n<li>a little bit of water</li>\n<li>salt</li>\n<li>something dear to their heart</li>\n</ul></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="164"><p>I figured I&apos;d beg a sprig of mint off a bartender making mojitos and swipe some salt packets from a napkin stand. Clover seemed like it might be hard to procure (1) when the city was blanketed under a fresh snowfall, and (2) inside the Vikings&apos; enclosed stadium&#x2014;but I thought I might be able to locate a microgreen garnish atop a luscious steak that I also thought I might be able to locate. A tape, pen, and paper, I was sure, would reveal themselves to me quite easily. It was the Super Bowl. Anything was possible.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="165"><p>Turns out most things were not possible. Not only did I not stumble upon a hidden field of clover, or steak garnished with microgreens&#x2014;I couldn&apos;t find mint anywhere. One after another, bartenders shook their heads. None of the custom cocktails (&quot;Jalapeno Pineapple Margarita,&quot; &quot;Mai Tai,&quot; &quot;Aviation&quot;) contained mint. No item available for purchase at the boldly named &quot;Wild and Fresh Market&quot; contained mint. I couldn&apos;t even find gum containing mint.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="166"><p>After about 30 minutes of searching (what was going on on the field, I have no idea), I came upon a promising lead: shrimp tacos. Mint and shrimp go together like dogs and logs! I ran my wild eyes over the menu description. No mint, but there <em>was</em> cilantro. It would have to do in a pinch. I asked the cashier if I could have a cup of cilantro, and offered to pay for it. She was reluctant to make me pay $11 for a commemorative Super Bowl cup just so I could have something to carry my cilantro in, but she was willing to have me pay $11 for Diet Pepsi in a commemorative Super Bowl cup and give me an employees-only paper cup of cilantro (pre-mixed with chopped red onion) on the side. She filled my commemorative cup up to the brim with icy cold fountain soda&#x2014;something I would love under normal circumstances, but this cup&apos;s purple holographic design made it extremely slippery to hold, and the cup lacked a lid.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="167"><p>&quot;Could I have a lid?&quot; I asked.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="168"><p>&quot;We don&apos;t have a lid for that,&quot; she said. Odd, but not a big deal. I walked to another stand and asked for a lid.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="169"><p>&quot;We don&apos;t have any lids,&quot; an employee informed me. &quot;People leave them on the ground, so we just don&apos;t have lids anymore. Even with a bottle of water, we&apos;re supposed to keep the lid.&quot;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="170"><p>I had never before encountered a lidless society, and after carefully placing my commemorative cup brimming with unchecked soda on a nearby table, I sent an excited message to my editor: &quot;No lids ANYWHERE. You CAN&apos;T GET A LID&quot;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="171"><p>&quot;I&apos;ll give you a point if you find a lid,&quot; he wrote back.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="172"><p>But here&apos;s what he didn&apos;t know: I had already procured a 100 percent illegal lid for myself.

For nearly his entire performance, the tens of thousands of people seated in the stadium sat motionless. They did not dance. They did not sing. They did not talk. They simply stared politely forward, the way you might if someone were giving a mildly engaging talk just before lunch at a business conference. All sounds of screaming excitement emanated from a group of people who appeared to have been brought onto the field and clustered around Timberlake&apos;s temporary stage specifically to provide an illusion of screaming excitement. I never knew something so loud could be so quiet. When Justin Timberlake commanded the crowd to hold their phones in the air, no one complied. Before the show, folks in my section had received detailed instructions about what to do with two mini flashlights placed at everyone&apos;s seats; few abided by them. The only song to generate even a moderate crowd response was &quot;Can&apos;t Stop the Feeling!&quot;&#x2014;a song Timberlake recorded for the soundtrack to the animated film <em>Trolls</em> <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/justin-timberlake-trolls-music">about which he once said the following</a>:</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="213"><p>&quot;I have always envisioned bringing the two worlds of film and music together for one epic event [and] couldn&apos;t be more excited that they will collide in DreamWorks&apos; <em>Trolls</em>.&quot;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="214"><p>By far the most exciting and visually impressive moment of the performance came at the very end, after Timberlake had left the stage, when the mob of dancers who&apos;d gathered to perform choreography with what appeared to be huge pieces of neon-colored cardboard were forced to run to the exits, to clear the field.</p></div><div class="embed figure" data-reactid="215"><figure class="embedded-video"><div class="player-container"><iframe height="" width="" src="https://streamable.com/s/gxo3v/twyfah"></iframe></div></figure></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="216"><p>&quot;That&apos;s it?&quot; asked a woman behind me.

Can a person ever truly &quot;look good&quot; once they have been positively identified as a Patriots fan? I contend the answer is <em>no</em>. Nonetheless, I did appreciate Katie&apos;s effort, so I awarded her photo a half point.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="223"><p>Later, seconds after a Patriots touchdown and subsequent crowd roar, I saw a man in a Tom Brady jersey run out of a men&apos;s room yelling, &quot;What&apos;d I miss?&quot; As I watched him, he craned his neck to an elevated TV screen and unleashed a guttural &quot;FUCK!&quot; his face contorting at his own misfortune. I thought that looked pretty good, so I awarded myself another half point and declared <strong>Item No. 9:</strong> Find a Pats fan looking good COMPLETE. 6 to go.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="224"><p>The other manner in which social media very nearly proved helpful was when I received the following direct message from a stranger in regards to Item No. 6: Get an Eagles fan to perform black magic with me.</p></div><div class="component-lazy pending" data-component="Lazy" data-reactid="225"></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="226"><p>As it turned out, I did not need that person&apos;s cousin&apos;s husband to join hands with me in league with Satan; while I was finishing up my third hot dog, a woman in an Eagles coat approached my standing table and asked if I wouldn&apos;t mind watching her drink while she went back to the bar to get another for her husband, because they would only sell her one at a time.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="227"><p>&quot;I&apos;ll do it if you perform a spell to curse Tom Brady with me when you get back,&quot; I said.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="228"><p>&quot;Fine, then,&quot; she agreed in a heavy Southern drawl. (She later told me that she was from South Carolina, married to a Philly native.)</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="229"><p>True to her word, when she returned, she chanted the following words with me over a pile of, basically, trash that I had made:</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="230"><p><em>Good luck go, Go away.

It was at one of these that I saw a white-haired man from Philadelphia folding bills into his wallet.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="235"><p>&quot;Excuse me, sir,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;m doing a scavenger hunt to win a mini fridge with the Eagles logo on it.

(Item No. 4: A personal story or previously unknown fact about Beyonc&#xE9;.) He hadn&apos;t.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="240"><p>&quot;I could have helped you with that one earlier,&quot; he said, pointing at Item No. 25: &quot;Dead bird.&quot;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="241"><p>&quot;You saw a dead bird?&quot; I asked. This item was on the list because a friend had informed me that huge numbers of birds <a href="http://audubonchapterofminneapolis.org/wpaudubon/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Report_2-20_Final.pdf">keep flying into the beautiful reflective glass</a> of the stadium and dying.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="242"><p>He nodded silently.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="243"><p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="244"><p>&quot;Outside my hotel.&quot;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="245"><p>&quot;What hotel?&quot;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="246"><p>&quot;The LivINN,&quot; he said. &quot;L-I-V-I-N-N. It was just lyin&apos; there, outside the door.&quot;</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="247"><p>&quot;Do you know what kind of bird it was?&quot; I asked.

The game was nearly over, the Patriots were now in the lead, and the remaining items on the list were proving impossible to find or accomplish. My evil spell had backfired, possibly due to my own use of substitute ingredients. What&apos;s worse, I had doubled its cursed impact and sacrificed the innocent soul of a woman from South Carolina who loved alcohol. I saw many men who appeared to be over 80 (Item No. 16), but they were all cordoned off in elite areas, and even if I could get to them, I was reluctant to interrupt their watching of the game to explain to these uniformed World War II veterans that I, a grown woman in a gold lam&#xE9; Eagles jacket, needed their help on a scavenger hunt of my own devising. I was reduced to wandering around the main concourse asking random strangers, &quot;Excuse me, have you or anyone you know ever met Beyonc&#xE9;?&quot; No one had. Most people seemed baffled by my question, which suggests to me that Beyonc&#xE9; needs to get out and meet more people. A few folks seemed to think I was some sort of hidden-camera game show they had no interest in playing.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="254"><p>I was in the midst of ascending and descending stairs and escalators in random order, haphazardly traversing concourses with no direction or purpose, when I found myself next to a glass-walled studio filled with dozens of TV monitors, each blaring a different oscillating graphic (&quot;FIIIiiirrSSSTttt DOOoooWWWnnNN!&quot;), and decided to rest. I was soon joined there by a woman in Philadelphia gear, her arms laden with food and drink she intended to bring back to her family in the stands. She and I chatted as we watched the game on TV, unable to tear ourselves away from the screens even though we were just a few feet away from where we could watch the game live. Our mood was low when suddenly, with just over two minutes left, the Eagles appeared to score another touchdown. She threw herself into my arms. &quot;I&apos;m gonna cry!&quot; she screamed into my chest. I hugged her as we both jumped up and down.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="255"><p>A man from behind us dismissed our joy. &quot;They&apos;re not gonna give it to them,&quot; he said. And, indeed, when we looked back, the catch was under review. The three of us, the man, the woman, and I, pressed our faces to the glass as the action was rewound and replayed dozens of times. Catch-bobble-catch; catch-bobble-catch; catch-bobble-catch. Finally, the touchdown call was upheld. &quot;You just won the Super Bowl,&quot; the man said. The woman and I hugged each other again, and ran off to make it to our respective seats before the final seconds of the game.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="256"><p>As soon as green confetti fell like beautiful acid rain, I lunged out of my seat and ran four levels through empty, echoing back tunnels to the ground, hoping that the clear &quot;NO FIELD ACCESS&quot; stamp on my media badge didn&apos;t matter anymore now that the Eagles had won. The first rule of Philadelphia is that there are no rules that cannot be set on fire and hurled through a storefront window in celebration. Turns out the first rule of Minneapolis is that you must respect all rules. I was stopped just a few feet from the field and forced to turn back around, which is when I saw Kevin Hart, looking dour, perhaps because he had just been forcibly removed from TV for swearing during a live broadcast, making his way down the tunnel with his entourage.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="257"><p>&quot;What&apos;s up, Kev?!&quot; I yelled. He ignored me. <strong>Item No. 24:</strong> Greet a celebrity like I know them. COMPLETED. 2 to go.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="258"><p>Forced back upstairs to join the disgusting ranks of the other people without field access, I bumped into another opportunity to score a last-minute scavenger hunt point: My co-worker A.J. Earlier in the evening, I had jokingly given him my Eagles baseball cap to wear, and despite the greenhouse-like temperature inside the stadium, he still had it on, in addition to his suede trench and cashmere turtleneck. The result was that A.J. no longer looked simply like a well-dressed man; he looked like a well-dressed man so full of affection and respect for the Philadelphia Eagles, he was willing to ruin a fantastic outfit by wearing a dirty old baseball cap advertising his support for them.</p></div><div class="component-lazy pending" data-component="Lazy" data-reactid="259"></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="260"><p>&quot;I&apos;m going to pretend to interview you,&quot; I said, holding up my phone like a recorder. A few people clapped at him as they walked by. Emboldened, A.J. started pointing at people as he gave me a pretend interview. He began saying &quot;thank you&quot; to Eagles fans unprompted. The more he thanked them, the more they congratulated him. He shrugged and nodded when they expressed excitement. I put my phone in my pocket, ran a few yards down the concourse, and doubled back to him.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="261"><p>&quot;I hate to do this,&quot; I said for the benefit of the crowd now making its way toward him. I pulled out my small notebook. &quot;Would you mind signing?&quot; After seeing A.J. sign an autograph for me, people began forming small lines to give him high-fives. Wary of attempting our charade for too long in one location, he and I decided to move around. He confidently began strolling around a few various elite club levels, while I rushed along a few paces behind him, in the manner of a harried assistant. A.J. continued to smile and nod at well-wishers and awed children. At some point, he decided internally that he was a retired former Eagles player and mused aloud to me, &quot;I wish it could have been in my day, but I&apos;m happy they finally got it.&quot; We finally stopped wandering, not because he got caught slipping seamlessly between club levels, but because it was so easy as to be unexciting. At 10 P.M. on Sunday night in U.S. Bank Stadium, it was assumed that a 6-foot-6 black man in a fur-lined coat and Eagles cap was supposed to be anywhere he was. <strong>Item No. 13:</strong> Make people think <em>GQ</em> employee A. J. Gibbson is more famous than Jessica Biel. COMPLETE. No offense, Jessica. One to go. No time left.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="262"><p>As fans surged out of the stadium on a current of dazed emotion, I was forced to confront the barren reality of my fate, with no officially licensed Philadelphia Eagles personal Refrigerated Beverage Center on the horizon. My drinks would forever be room temperature, or located in a non&#x2013;Philadelphia Eagles brand regular-size refrigerator far away from my cubicle. My afternoons would be filled not with the gentle hum of drinks being continuously cooled, but the booming silence of a distinct LACK of electricity. I had lost, but at least the Eagles had won.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="263"><p>But then.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="264"><p>A few feet ahead of me, I saw her&#x2014;a symbol of hope for the future, specifically my future, specifically my future filled with up to 20 chilled beverages at a time: a very, very young baby. (Item No. 15.) By far the youngest I had seen all night.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="265"><p>As if pulled by an invisible string wrapped around that baby&apos;s finger, I glided silently away from extremely famous retired NFL player <em>GQ</em>&apos;s A. J. Gibbson. I peered at the baby&apos;s little face, smushed delicately between enormous pink baby earphones. She was wearing an infant-size knit Eagles cap and crying softly to herself.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="266"><p>&quot;How old is your daughter?&quot; I asked the woman bouncing her lightly in her arms.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="267"><p>&quot;She&apos;s my granddaughter, actually,&quot; said the smiling lady, clad in matching Eagles gear. &quot;Two months.&quot; My heart sank. Why couldn&apos;t this baby have been brand newer? &quot;I think she&apos;s ready for these headphones to come off,&quot; she added.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="268"><p>&quot;Maybe she&apos;s crying because she&apos;s so happy they won,&quot; I said. The grandmother and I wished each other a good night and I walked back to collect my things. As I prepared to leave the stadium, I glanced back at the baby in time to see her being handed off to her mother. It was then that I noticed the word on the back of the beanie, spelled out in gleaming Swarovski crystals: D-A-D. My eyes flew to her mother&apos;s jersey, adorned with matching crystals: GOODE 52. Then to her grandmother&apos;s: GOODE 52. Everyone in their party was wearing the same jersey. My fingers opened Instagram so fast, my iPhone glass threatened to melt in my hands. There was the baby, on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BegBDRHH9Ew/?">her mom&apos;s Instagram</a>, in the arms of a beaming linebacker&#x2014;Najee Goode, #52, Philadelphia Eagles.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="269"><p><strong>Item No. 22:</strong> Meet member of a player&apos;s immediate family.</p></div><div class="embed p" data-reactid="270"><p>Like the Philadelphia Eagles, I had achieved the impossible.
