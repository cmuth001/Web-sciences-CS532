A glacial wind intermittently swirls from the Phoenix Park direction, briefly subsiding before another harsh gust cuts across moments of peaceful reflection.</p>\n<p>There are two other people in sight. An elderly woman, wrapped from the elements in a headscarf, and, further in the distance, a cemetery worker busily clearing leaves.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get lost in your thoughts.</p>\n<p>A few plots \xe2\x80\x94 nine, to be exact \xe2\x80\x94 up on the right hand side from the main entrance, one headstone stands out, not only for its size but for its white granite finish, embellished with a\xc2\xa0statue of Our Lady of Lourdes on top.</p>\n<p>Placed on the grave are red and white flowers with a Manchester United club scarf wrapped around a vase inscribed with the family name. It\xe2\x80\x99s immaculately maintained and beautifully poignant.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">In Loving Memory of My Dear Son Liam Whelan,<br>\nOf 28, St Attracta Road, Cabra,<br>\nManchester United AFC.<br>\nWho died in the Munich Air Disaster,<br>\n6th February 1958,<br>\nAged 22 years.</p>\n<p>Those words resonate like never before.</p>\n<p>Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s an age thing, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s just the week that\xe2\x80\x99s in it.</p>\n<p>Either way, there is a deep, profound connection.</p>\n<p>There is an understanding, and greater appreciation, of what happened, who he was and how the devastating events of 6 February 1958 had such a reverberating effect through so many lives, so close to home.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>\n<p>Last Saturday,\xc2\xa0a large crowd gathered under the Munich Clock, in the south-east corner of Old Trafford, as the 23 victims of the Munich Air Disaster were remembered through prayers, readings and a moving\xc2\xa0rendition of \xe2\x80\x98The Flowers of Manchester\xe2\x80\x99.</p>\n<p>The East Stand\xe2\x80\x99s all-glass facade, overlooking the main stadium forecourt, has three large banners running vertically, the centrepiece being a printed replica of the Munich Clock which sits over the statue of Sir Matt Busby. On either side, a list of names.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">Geoff Bent<br>\nRoger Byrne<br>\nEddie Colman<br>\nDuncan Edwards<br>\nMark Jones<br>\nDavid Pegg<br>\nTommy Taylor<br>\nLiam \xe2\x80\x98Billy\xe2\x80\x99 Whelan.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">The Busby Babes.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">The English League Champions.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">The Flowers of Manchester.</p>\n<p>For so many people, for so many reasons, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t an ordinary match day.</p>\n<p>The visit of Huddersfield Town to Old Trafford may outwardly be a\xc2\xa0peripheral fixture in the context of Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s season, but there is more to this day than football. And particularly this year, the 60th year.</p>\n<p>As part of the commemorations, the current Manchester United players wear black armbands and kick off is preceded by a minute\xe2\x80\x99s silence, during which Old Trafford falls deathly silent. It carries significance, and undiluted emotion.</p>\n<p><span class="journal_embed_container parent_aligncenter" style="" ><span class="journal_caption_container"><span class="journal_caption_container"><img src="http://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/3833966/original/?width=630&version=3833966" alt="Manchester United v Huddersfield Town - Premier League - Old Trafford" class="aligncenter inline-image"  /><span class="journal_caption">\n    Supporters during a memorial for the victims of the Munich Air Disaster outside Old Trafford last Saturday.</span>\n</span><span class="journal_credit">\n    Source: Martin Rickett</span></span></span></p>\n<p>Sitting in the Director\xe2\x80\x99s Box are the families of the victims alongside one of only two remaining survivors, Sir Bobby Charlton, and they will return again later today for a service at Old Trafford, which on days like this truly is a special place, and not just the\xc2\xa0commercialised version it is often portrayed to be.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the same can be said about Manchester United as a club.</p>\n<p>74,742 were inside Old Trafford to watch Jose Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side win 2-0 and, for the majority, that\xe2\x80\x99s what mattered. It\xe2\x80\x99s what they came to see. But perhaps they left \xe2\x80\x94 some heading back to far-flung places \xe2\x80\x94 with a better education and understanding of what makes the club they\xe2\x80\x99ve come to worship the way it is.</p>\n<p>And why whatever happens on the field, there is a timeless aura of indomitability and a sense of identity forged by the collective suffering through the years.\xc2\xa0And why there is a Munich Clock and Tunnel\xc2\xa0forever remembering the men lost on that dark day.</p>\n<p>And why those who died in Munich became an eternal flame in Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s history and thus a guiding light for everything the club has gone on to become and achieve.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine how the crowds managed to all congregate on this side of the cemetery as they did for the funeral. One of the gravediggers told the family he had not seen as many people in Glasnevin since the burial of Michael Collins.</p>\n<p>The pictures, although a little grainy, are staggering. You can see rows and rows of people, men and women, young and old, as the heartbreak felt in Manchester extended to an unprecedented outpouring of grief on the streets of Dublin. The city came to a standstill.</p>\n<p>The funeral cortege from Dublin Airport to Christ the King Church in Cabra was flanked by thousands upon thousands, as Liam Whelan arrived home on 10 February 1958, four days after he lost his life when\xc2\xa0British European Airways flight 609 failed to take off on its third attempt at\xc2\xa0Munich-Riem Airport. He was just 22. He was Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s Busby Babe.</p>\n<p>Eight Manchester United players suffered fatal injuries on that inexplicably tragic day, and 15 other passengers \xe2\x80\x94 including three members of club staff and eight members of the travelling press \xe2\x80\x94 were killed. Matt Busby\xe2\x80\x99s young team were on their way back from a European Cup tie in Belgrade. They\xc2\xa0were the future of the club, they represented everything about the club. And then Munich. Such shock, such loss.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cWords cannot describe the devastating effect that this disaster had on the football club and the lives of those affected,\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Bobby Charlton wrote in a recent letter to Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s current players. \xe2\x80\x9cThis great football club, which you are part of, has risen from its darkest hour in a way like no other.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em style="text-align: center;">***</em></p>\n<p>Two hours have passed and we\xe2\x80\x99ve barely scratched the surface.

He could pass, dribble, shoot and finish. He had a wand of a right foot. He had it all.</p>\n<p>In a young side nurtured and moulded by Busby and his assistant Jimmy Murphy, containing the likes of Charlton and Duncan Edwards, Whelan was the schemer, the playmaker. He made things tick.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the games we went over to was Blackpool at Old Trafford and the great Stanley Matthews was playing,\xe2\x80\x9d Christy recalls.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9dWe were in the near stand at the time and the ball was over the far side and Matthews had it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>He was rolling the ball and went by somebody, I forget who it was, but who appeared, only Liam. And he took the ball off him and stood in front of Matthews and just kept rolling the ball back and forward down by the corner flag and nutmegged him.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the crowd stood up in the stand: \xe2\x80\x98Go on, Billy!

They\xe2\x80\x99re proud of him around these parts, and he was proud to be from Cabra.</p>\n<p>His connection with home remained strong during his four years in Manchester, and Whelan, a devout Catholic who suffered from terrible homesickness, would jump on the B&amp;I Ferry back to Dublin as often as he could.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe used to go down and meet him at the North Wall,\xe2\x80\x9d John remembers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boat took 14 hours from Liverpool and there were times he used to come home and never say a word and just walk in the door.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s favourite saying then was \xe2\x80\x98when are you going back?\xe2\x80\x99 because she wanted to know how long he\xe2\x80\x99d be with us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p><span class="journal_embed_container parent_aligncenter" style="" ><span class="journal_caption_container"><span class="journal_caption_container"><img src="http://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/3834166/original/?width=374&version=3834166" alt="Soccer - Football League Division One - Manchester United" class="aligncenter inline-image"  /><span class="journal_caption">\n    Whelan started his career with Home Farm before moving to Manchester United at the age of 18.</span>\n</span><span class="journal_credit">\n    Source: S&G and Barratts/EMPICS Sport</span></span></span></p>\n<p>Born to Elizabeth and John Whelan of St Attracta Road on 1 April 1935, Liam was one of seven children \xe2\x80\x94 Bridie, Alice, Christy, Liam, Rita, Maura and John \xe2\x80\x94 but the family tragically lost their father when Liam was just eight, although his love of soccer had already been handed down to eldest son Christy, who had been going to nearby Dalymount Park since the age of five.</p>\n<p>Christy himself was a fine player in the League of Ireland, but he soon gave up his own career to follow his younger brother, who was fast becoming the star after first kicking a ball in a playground not far from the family home.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cLiam played in the playground very regularly and there was a team called Red Rockets,\xe2\x80\x9d Christy explains. \xe2\x80\x9cThey used to go around playing in Dublin city and were unbeaten for two years.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cFrom that, someone suggested he go to join Home Farm and he started playing there at 13. It was a long way away for us at the time with no cars so he used to cycle up to the club. He went from U14 right up, and played a year above himself as well as his own team.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe got a schoolboy cap for Ireland then and they played England at Goodison Park and won that game 8-4.\xc2\xa0Liam didn\xe2\x80\x99t score but he was the best player on the pitch that day.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>On the back of that performance, several of the Irish team were invited for trials at Manchester United and a couple of them \xe2\x80\x94 Paddy Kennedy and Noel McFarlane \xe2\x80\x94 were offered contracts at Old Trafford. But there was no interest in Liam, and despite standing out in Home Farm colours, that continued for another couple of years.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss one game he played for Home Farm and I used to come home wondering why there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody [scouts] coming to see him play,\xe2\x80\x9d Christy says, shaking his head, still to this day bemused by it.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cI used to be saying this to my mother all the time: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s going wrong here, people in this country don\xe2\x80\x99t see it but Liam is the best player I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in this country.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>***</em></p>\n<p>There were five tables, each of 10 people, all from completely different backgrounds and walks of life, but all united by Munich.\xc2\xa0Some knew each other from these events down through the years, others had been passed the baton to carry on the legacy of their loved one.</p>\n<p>There were brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, nieces, nephews, cousins, grandchildren, great nieces, great nephews and great-grandchildren, but there was no generation gap. Just an afternoon of mournful reflection and a celebration of everything the Busby Babes stood for through the exchange of stories.\xc2\xa0It was special.</p>\n<p>Hearing how Northern Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s Jackie Blanchflower suffered injuries so severe that he would never play again or how Harry Gregg, who was sitting beside Liam on ill-fated flight 609 but escaped the burning wreckage to save some of his team-mates, including Charlton, could not bring himself to attend this anniversary event because a return to Old Trafford carried too much emotion.

He was a great schoolboy at that time as well and went to Glasgow Celtic afterwards, but they had come to sign him for United.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cLiam played well that day. He was brilliant. Just before half-time,\xc2\xa0Bert Whalley turns to Billy Behan and says \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want Ryan, get Whelan and get him as soon as you can.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Through the vision of Matt Busby, who held the view that the only way to lay long-lasting foundations for success was through youth, Manchester United placed huge emphasis on developing their own talent, and at the same time created a pattern and philosophy which ran right through from their underage teams to the first team; a free-flowing, thrilling and attractive brand of football which revolutionised the English game.</p>\n<p>The Busby Babes offered a template for entertaining football that quickly became the central ideology of Manchester United, and at 18 years of age, a supremely talented young Irish inside-forward fit perfectly into that mould.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe came home and I was in bed that night, it was fairly late, and half asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d Christy continues. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bedroom door opened and a hand started shaking my shoulder.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99Christy, Christy,\xe2\x80\x99 and I turned and looked, it was Liam. \xe2\x80\x98Can you come downstairs?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\xe2\x80\x9cI thought there was something wrong.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99There\xe2\x80\x99s some man here from Manchester United,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, to which I replied; \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s about bloody time.\xe2\x80\x99</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe had no dressing gowns so it was an overcoat I put on and went downstairs and Billy Behan was standing there in the living room with Tom Smith from Home Farm.</p>\n<p><span class="journal_embed_container parent_aligncenter" style="" ><span class="journal_caption_container"><span class="journal_caption_container"><img src="http://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/3834590/original/?width=389&version=3834590" alt="Soccer - Bert Whalley and Matt Busby - Ringway Airport, Manchester" class="aligncenter inline-image"  /><span class="journal_caption">\n    Manchester United coach Bert Whalley (left) with Matt Busby.</span>\n</span><span class="journal_credit">\n    Source: PA Archive/PA Images</span></span></span></p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cBilly just said \xe2\x80\x98We want Liam to go over to Manchester United.

Off he went at 18.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cI cried that night.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>\n<p>There was a strong Irish connection at Manchester United at the time. Noel McFarlane, Tommy Hamilton, Jackie Mooney, Joe Carolan, Jackie Hennessy and a young Johnny Giles were all also on the books at Old Trafford during the 1950s and became great friends.</p>\n<p>Some came and went without ever really making their mark on the first team, but Whelan made an instant impact, starring in the FA Youth Cup final win over Wolves just three days after he signed for the club.</p>\n<p>With local lad John Doherty out injured, Whelan was drafted straight into an extraordinarily gifted team containing\xc2\xa0Kennedy, McFarlane, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, David Pegg and Albert Scanlon, and they won the first leg 7-1 at Old Trafford, with Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s new recruit scoring the final goal late on before finding the net during a 2-2 second leg draw.</p>\n<p>The club would dominate the FA Youth Cup for the first five years of the competition\xe2\x80\x99s existence and Busby\xe2\x80\x99s policy of investing in youth and building teams of world-class footballers was now in full swing.</p>\n<p>Not only did the Scot, who had taken his first steps into management with Manchester United in 1945, foster a seismic transition but was bold and brave enough to change the guard and introduce a raft of young rookies into the team.</p>\n<p><span class="journal_embed_container parent_aligncenter" style="" ><span class="journal_caption_container"><span class="journal_caption_container"><img src="http://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/3835485/original/?width=630&version=3835485" alt="Soccer - European Cup Semi Final - 2nd Leg - Manchester United v Real Madrid - Old Trafford, Manchester" class="aligncenter inline-image"  /><span class="journal_caption">\n    Whelan (right) in action against Real Madrid in the European Cup in April 1957.</span>\n</span><span class="journal_credit">\n    Source: PA Archive/PA Images</span></span></span></p>\n<p>Whelan had to bide his time before getting his opportunity, but Busby knew of the Irishman\xe2\x80\x99s talent and potential from the outset, particularly after his performances during a youth tournament in Bern, during which watching scouts from Brazilian club Santos made enquiries about his availability.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe was brilliant and the Brazilians at times stood up and clapped him, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe how good he was,\xe2\x80\x9d John remembers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe skill he had, he had tremendous skill on the ball. He got man of the match and the Brazilians talked to Matt Busby that day.</p>\n\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut Busby said: \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s going nowhere.

It\xe2\x80\x99s just a short, straight walk up towards Old Trafford via Sir Matt Busby Way and not far from Manchester city centre.</p>\n<p>The greenery is a little overgrown in the front garden and barely recognisable from the last time Christy Whelan was there back in 1954, on one of the many trips over to visit his brother.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s completely different to how I imagined it,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughs, looking at a photograph he\xe2\x80\x99s just taken out of his wallet. \xe2\x80\x9cThere you are now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Standing in the driveway are Mrs Whelan, Joe Carolan, Johnny Giles, Christy and the housekeeper Ms Gibbs, who watered and fed Liam and Bobby Charlton during the two years they shared the residence together.</p>\n<p>During that time, Whelan was learning his trade for Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s reserve team in the harsh environments of the Central League but his class shone through, becoming a prolific goalscorer to quickly turn the head of Busby.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe really started shining then,\xe2\x80\x9d says John.</p>\n<p>Five days short of his 20th birthday, the young forward was called upon for Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s First Division game against Preston North End at Deepdale on 26 March 1955.</p>\n<p>His first game at senior level ended in a 2-0 victory thanks to goals from Roger Byrne and Scanlon, and the following week Whelan scored the first of his 52 goals in red in a 5-0 demolition of Sheffield United at Old Trafford.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn his first full season, United won the league by an incredible 11 points but Liam had only played 13 games and you needed to play a third of them to get a medal,\xe2\x80\x9d John continues. \xe2\x80\x9cBut somehow Matt got Liam a medal and then the following year, he was an ever-present in the team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>The Babes were blossoming and taking English football by storm.

It was a staggering achievement.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat year John went over during Easter for the Burnley game. He wrote to Liam before going over to say he was coming with a group from Home Farm. Anyway, he scored twice that day at Turf Moor and needless to say we were over the moon. Proud as anything.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>\n<p>Off the field, Liam Whelan was a quiet, shy and humble character. He longed for home but at the same time began to settle into life in Manchester \xe2\x80\x94 where he was known as Billy \xe2\x80\x94 growing up alongside his team-mates in shared digs, creating a formidable and unbreakable team spirit among a young squad.</p>\n<p>Both Whelan and the club were reaching rarefied heights, and after their domestic success, soon became European trailblazers despite pressure from the Football Association to decline the opportunity to play on the continent, like Chelsea had done the previous year.</p>\n<p>The FA did not want the midweek European travel to affect domestic fixtures but the single-minded and visionary Busby ignored the traditionalists and in realising the boundless benefits of competing against other league winners, refused to bow to higher powers.</p>\n<p>In the 1957/58 European Cup, Manchester United were drawn against Shamrock Rovers in the preliminary round, with the first leg of the tie taking place at Dalymount Park. It was the first time a League of Ireland club had qualified for the competition and the game was all the talk around Dublin at the time.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat was some night,\xe2\x80\x9d Christy says, brimming with pride.</p>\n<p>Working in the Corporation at the time, one of his colleagues had organised a sweepstake for the first goalscorer and, rather inevitably, Christy drew his brother, who was lining out in the red of United.</p>\n<p><span class="journal_embed_container parent_aligncenter" style="" ><span class="journal_caption_container"><span class="journal_caption_container"><img src="http://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/3835502/original/?width=353&version=3835502" alt="Billy Whelan" class="aligncenter inline-image"  /><span class="journal_caption">\n    Whelan scored twice at Dalymount Park against Rovers.</span>\n</span><span class="journal_credit">\n    Source: PA Archive/PA Images</span></span></span></p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cLiam scored twice, but unfortunately it was the wrong two goals he scored,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughs.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe sweep was half a dollar\xc2\xa0a man, that was two shillings and a sixpence. That was a good bit of money.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Liam was leaving the house that evening to go to Dalymount I said \xe2\x80\x98hey Mister, I have you in the sweep in work\xe2\x80\x99. \xe2\x80\x98Good\xe2\x80\x99, he said and off he went.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too long gone in the match and the ball came over and unusually for him he missed a wide-open goal. He missed it and cost me the money! But he scored the second and the third goal and United won 6-0.\xc2\xa0He had a brilliant game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>With family members dotted around various parts of Dalymount Park, that was a particularly memorable night for the Whelans.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother was in the stand and there were tears,\xe2\x80\x9d Christy continues.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>The one thing that Liam\xe2\x80\x99s two uncles used to say was \xe2\x80\x98if only Johnny was alive\xe2\x80\x99. That was my father. He was fanatical about soccer and\xc2\xa0I remember Stephen was over in the house after that match.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was sitting beside him and he turned to me. \xe2\x80\x98You know something, Christy? The saddest part about it all, is that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t live to get to see him, Liam. He would have loved it\xe2\x80\x99 and he was right. It was a great shame.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>\n<p>There isn\xe2\x80\x99t much footage of Liam Whelan in action available, but the clips that are online provide a perfect snapshot of the type of player he was. See his stunning, virtuoso goal in the European Cup quarter-final against Athletic Bilbao as the prime example.</p>\n<p>With United trailing 5-2 in the snow and mud, Busby\xe2\x80\x99s side were heading towards elimination when, with five minutes of the first leg remaining, Whelan produced a remarkable moment of individual brilliance to spark an incredible comeback.</p>\n<p>Collecting the ball in the middle of the field, he skips past three would-be tacklers before cutting back inside onto his powerful right foot to rifle home into the top-corner from the edge of the area.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cPeople always remember Liam for his goals, but we remember him for his ability. He was just a brilliant footballer in a brilliant team,\xe2\x80\x9d continues John.</p>\n<p>United went on to win the second leg 3-0 and advance to the semi-finals, where their first European odyssey ended at the hands of Real Madrid. That was five months before Munich. Disaster lurked around the corner.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened,\xe2\x80\x9d Christy says, bowing his head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen nowadays.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>The Busby Babes were near-certainties to complete a hat-trick of league titles in the 1957/58 season, and as more talented young players came through the system and the established stars reached their prime, the potential of the team knew no bounds.</p>\n<p>There also seemed every chance that an elusive, and much sought-after, League and Cup double \xe2\x80\x94 having lost the 1957 FA Cup final to Aston Villa \xe2\x80\x94 would become a reality at last and having reached the last four of the European Cup at the first attempt, there was no reason why they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go two steps further second time around.</p>\n<p><span class="journal_embed_container parent_aligncenter" style="" ><span class="journal_caption_container"><span class="journal_caption_container"><img src="http://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/3835505/original/?width=378&version=3835505" alt="Soccer - Football League Division One - Manchester United Photocall" class="aligncenter inline-image"  /><span class="journal_caption">\n    Whelan and team-mate Jackie Blanchflower during a training session.</span>\n</span><span class="journal_credit">\n    Source: S&G and Barratts/EMPICS Sport</span></span></span></p>\n<p>After an early slump in form, including three defeats in four games, Busby made a couple of bold changes to his side, as he dropped\xc2\xa0Ray Wood, Johnny Berry, David Pegg and Whelan, with his close friend Charlton occupying the inside-forward position.</p>\n<p>Busby\xe2\x80\x99s decision was instantly vindicated as\xc2\xa0United\xe2\x80\x99s form and results turned a corner and they embarked on a run of nine games unbeaten but because of the tragic events to come, Whelan\xe2\x80\x99s last game for the club was in a 1-0 defeat to Chelsea in December 1957.</p>\n<p>Having been beset by a bout of the flu, while also hearing news from back home of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s bad health, he remained out of the team at the expense of Charlton by the time United reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup.</p>\n<p>After safely advancing past Shamrock Rovers in that famous tie, they made light work of Dukla Prague to set-up a last eight date with Red Star Belgrade in January 1958.</p>\n<p>Busby\xe2\x80\x99s side were far from their clinical best in the first leg but managed to emerge with a 2-1 victory before travelling to Belgrade for the second leg on 5 February 1958. They drew 3-3 but advanced to a second successive\xc2\xa0European semi-final 5-4 on aggregate.</p>\n<p>The great tragedy is that Whelan had sought permission from Busby to return home to Dublin for a few days, but the United manager wanted the whole squad to travel to Serbia in a show of unity.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only a matter of time before Liam got back in the team but he wanted to come home,\xe2\x80\x9d John explains. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could see where Matt was coming from because if anyone got injured, there was no sense in Liam being in Dublin.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut he wanted to come home to make arrangements for his wedding. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought anyway. He was engaged to Ruby and they were due to get married the following summer but that was it, he went on the trip. God knows his own ways.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div><em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe tragic news of Liam Whelan\xe2\x80\x99s death reached his family home at St Attracta Road, Cabra, late last night, after hours of agonised waiting. From the time the first reports of the disaster reached Dublin, crowds gathered at the Whelan home and phone calls for news of Liam were put through to Manchester at regular intervals on a phone in a neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s house. Schoolboy friends waited silently, hoping against hope for the word that he survived.\xe2\x80\x9d</em></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em>\xe2\x80\x93 The Irish Press, 7 February 1958.</em></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After celebrating their victory at the post-match banquet the night before, Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s players boarded the twin-engined British European Airways plane, flight 609, for their journey back to Manchester via Munich to refuel.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival at a snow-covered and sub-zero Munich-Riem Airport, the squad got off the plane to spend some time in the terminal building before embarking on the second leg of their trip home. Shortly after 2pm local time, the 44 passengers were back on the aircraft and the first of three aborted take-off attempts was made.</p>\n<p>As the pilot attempted to get the aircraft, known as the Lord Burleigh, off the ground, the engine made a strange noise and captain James Thain and his co-pilot Kenneth Rayment slammed on the brakes, stopping just 400 yards from the end of the runway.</p>\n<p>A couple of minutes later, a second attempt was abandoned in near identical circumstances, before the aircraft was taxied back to the terminal to be examined by engineers on the ground. At that stage, everyone on board returned to the relative warmth of the lounge.</p>\n<p><span class="journal_embed_container parent_aligncenter" style="" ><span class="journal_caption_container"><span class="journal_caption_container"><img src="http://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/3835622/original/?width=630&version=3835622" alt="Soccer - European Cup - Semi Final First Leg - Real Madrid v Manchester United - United Fly From Ringway Airport, Manchester" class="aligncenter inline-image"  /><span class="journal_caption">\n    23 of the 44 passengers lost their life in Munich.</span>\n</span><span class="journal_credit">\n    Source: PA Archive/PA Images</span></span></span></p>\n<p>By 3.02pm, a decision had been made. The pilot informed the control tower that they would try again, for a third time. The engineers were satisfied that the noise didn\xe2\x80\x99t pose a safety threat and Thain was content that the wings hadn\xe2\x80\x99t iced over.</p>\n<p>Passengers who survived have since described the mood as apprehensive, but there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a great deal of panic, although the previous boisterous mood as the players played cards had silenced considerably.\xc2\xa0Some, including Duncan Edwards, Tommy Taylor and Mark Jones, had decided to move to the back of the aircraft in the hope it was safer.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an awful decision,\xe2\x80\x9d John says. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were actually photographs of some of the players sweeping snow off the wings. There were under pressure to get home. They had a league fixture to fulfil on the Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>The aircraft failed to gather enough speed on the icy surface, overshooting the runway and smashing through the perimeter fence and into a nearby house.\xc2\xa0As the plane hurtled along the slushy runway and towards destruction, Liam uttered the chilling words: \xe2\x80\x9cIf this is the end, then I am ready for it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>The cockpit hit a tree and part of the fuselage slammed into an airport fuel hut, which instantly exploded. The wing and part of the back were torn off. Some were killed instantly, others lay among the debris unconscious and beyond help.\xc2\xa0Utter destruction and devastation.</p>\n<p>Back home in Dublin, the Whelan family learned of the shattering news hours after it had first broken.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was sitting in a chair like this in front of the fire at the time and the next thing I heard the gate,\xe2\x80\x9d Christy recalls.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother and Alice were out the back ironing and I saw it was Charlie Jackson, who used to look after Liam\xe2\x80\x99s team in Home Farm. He was a good friend of the family.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cI shouted out \xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99s Charlie\xe2\x80\x99 and my mother came into the front room and pointed at the clock and said \xe2\x80\x98they\xe2\x80\x99re home Charlie, they\xe2\x80\x99re home.\xe2\x80\x99</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not, Mrs Whelan,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, Charlie? They\xe2\x80\x99re home, Charlie.\xe2\x80\x99</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\xe2\x80\x9cHave you not heard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come up to offer my condolences and to be with you when we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting.\xc2\xa0The plane has crashed.\xe2\x80\x9d</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole of Dublin knew and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Christy continues, looking to the sky. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were all in here and we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>As news filtered through and the whole picture emerged, the scale of the tragedy became agonisingly clear.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe would get the bulletins and they were going through all the names: Geoff Bent \xe2\x80\x94 dead. Eddie Colman \xe2\x80\x94 dead. Tommy Taylor \xe2\x80\x94 dead. But there was no mention of Liam. The house was full of people but we all knew.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe eventually got a phone call and I went in and it was Jimmy Murphy\xe2\x80\xa6</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Christy, we\xe2\x80\x99ve bad news,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Liam didn\xe2\x80\x99t survive. From what\xe2\x80\x99s left here at Old Trafford, we send our sympathies.

She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to believe it. She took it badly and late that night, she came into me and said: \xe2\x80\x98Christy, if he was dead, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the police have come to us?\xe2\x80\x99</p>\n<p>He pauses, before adding: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I had to tell her\xe2\x80\xa6I had to tell her that the police had come and given official notice of Liam\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>\n<p>Liam Whelan\xe2\x80\x99s prodigious talent may have been extinguished, but his legacy and legend has grown over the years since his death. His record for Manchester United speaks for itself and it\xe2\x80\x99s widely acknowledged that he was not just cut down in his prime, but before he had even reached it.</p>\n<p>Described as the lost talent of Irish football, Whelan was nudging greatness when tragedy intruded, and it was perhaps his unassuming disposition, and reluctance to appear in the media, that cost him the affection in which some of his team-mates were held.</p>\n<p>But from anyone who knew him, played with him or watched him play,\xc2\xa0there was nothing but adulation and admiration for one of the finest players of his generation who would have undoubtedly gone on to even greater things.</p>\n<p>He earned four international caps for the Boys in Green during Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s qualifying campaign for the 1958 World Cup, but was cruelly denied the opportunity to truly fulfil his potential both for club and country.</p>\n<p>Under the tutelage of Busby and Murphy, and playing alongside such gifted players at Old Trafford, the horizon for Whelan appeared boundless. Without question, he was one of the greatest footballers Ireland has ever produced.</p>\n<p>Even more heartbreaking was the fact he was due to be joined in Manchester by his soon-to-be wife Ruby and the pair planned on settling down together in England, which would certainly have eased his homesickness and helped his performances on the pitch. Alas, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe had a great career for the time he was there but if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t have been homesick he would have been even better,\xe2\x80\x9d Christy laments.</p>\n<p>Whelan\xe2\x80\x99s death left a hole as big as any at Old Trafford, where he was revered but it was back home in Cabra where he was beloved both personally and professionally by those who both knew him, grew up with him and followed him.</p>\n<p><span class="journal_embed_container parent_aligncenter" style="" ><span class="journal_caption_container"><span class="journal_caption_container"><img src="http://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/3835952/original/?width=630&version=3835952" alt="Image uploaded from iOS (7)" class="aligncenter inline-image"  /><span class="journal_caption">\n    Liam\'s brothers Christy Whelan (left), John Whelan (centre) and brother-in-law Michael Burke looking at the 1957 FA Cup final programme.</span>\n</span><span class="journal_credit">\n    Source: The42/Ryan Bailey</span></span></span></p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cLiam loved to stay involved with the community,\xe2\x80\x9d Christy continues. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a five-a-side tournament in Dalymount Park and Liam brought a team over from England. He was home in the house anyway and a few kids, maybe six to eight year olds, knocked on the door and asked \xe2\x80\x98is Liam coming out?\xe2\x80\x99</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe had just played in the FA Cup final at Wembley but Liam wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say no to anybody. He gave them money to go to the shop up by the bridge [now named after him] to buy a ball and when they got back, he was out playing on the road with them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\xe2\x80\x9cHe was so popular. He never gave anyone any reason to say \xe2\x80\x98that fella is a bloody snob\xe2\x80\x99. When he was home, he\xe2\x80\x99d stop and chat to everyone. He was so loved and we saw that at the funeral. It was a sad occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In just four years at Manchester United, he left a lasting legacy and achieved immortality through his gifted performances in red and the part he had to play in the evolution and success of the Busby Babes.</p>\n<p>His team-mates were all universal in praise. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a youngster, I always wanted to be the best player in the world but as long as Liam Whelan was around I doubted if I could,\xe2\x80\x9d Bobby Charlton wrote in his book, providing another indication of just how highly he was rated.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows how good he would have been,\xe2\x80\x9d John remarks, desperate to know the answer. But at the end of the day, football and goals and caps is all a trivial matter in the greater context of the tragedy to befall Matt Busby\xe2\x80\x99s thrilling, pioneering young team.</p>\n<p>Lives, futures and families were shattered on that indelible day, today 60 years ago.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe it\xe2\x80\x99s that long ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Christy adds. \xe2\x80\x9cBut one thing is for sure: Liam is never forgotten. He\xe2\x80\x99s never forgotten and never will be.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>My mother had a very good way of looking at it and she always said \xe2\x80\x98God wanted Liam\xe2\x80\x99 and that helped us a lot. It got us through those days and weeks and months and years. It gets us through even now all these years after. God wanted Liam and that\xe2\x80\x99s how we saw it.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all so proud of him and the memories have always been there.\xc2\xa0He was so skilful and they [the press] used to say he was slow, but he could get there! He could take them all on and beat them. He was terrific, he was a terrific boy.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cLiam will never be forgotten and even long after we\xe2\x80\x99re gone, his memory will be kept going by the rest of the family.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p><strong>The 42 is on Instagram!
